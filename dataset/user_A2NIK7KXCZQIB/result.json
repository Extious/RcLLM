    "title": "Coanir Facial Sauna System with Timer",
    "description": "This unit can be used to steam open pores for cleansing skin and to steam open  clogged nasal and sinus passages. The versatility comes from two translucent, blue,  plastic cones. The large cone is 6-3/4 inches wide and has a flared, open side to  accommodate the face, chin, and neck for cleansing. The small cone is 3-1/2 inches wide,  so steam is directed into the nose where it can be breathed in during allergy and cold  season. Operating the steamer is simple: using the included measuring tube, pour tap  water into the power base's reservoir; twist on and lock into place either of the tubes;  switch on the unit with the on/off button; and wait about three minutes for the water to  heat. For controlled cleansing sessions there's a timer than can be set from 3 to 15  minutes. And for safety the unit automatically shuts off after 45 minutes.--Fred Brack",

    "description": "StriVectin-SD is a cutting-edge anti-wrinkle and stretch mark repair cream that can help you look younger and more beautiful by reducing the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and other effects of aging. This revolutionary anti-aging cream utilizes the most advanced ingredients available today. The active ingredients not only help to firm, hydrate, and tighten facial skin but also help to repair the appearance of fines lines and stretch marks. To achieve these results, StriVectin-SD uses a patented pentapeptide that has produced results unseen in the cosmetic industry. With a host of the industry's best anti-aging ingredients, our blend targets more than wrinkles, including such major problem areas as sagging skin, skin discoloration, dryness, and rough skin. StriVectin-SD has come to be known as the safe alternative to Botox, providing equal or better results without the risk. StriVectin-SD offers immediate results targeting the category of fine lines, wrinkles, and crows feet and can remove 10 to 15 years from your complexion. The isolates in StriVectin-SD were shown in clinical studies to dramatically improve skin smoothness and decrease wrinkle depth as it increases collagen and elastin. It was shown to be even more effective than Retinol or Vitamin C in reducing fine facial lines and wrinkles while diminishing the signs of aging.",
