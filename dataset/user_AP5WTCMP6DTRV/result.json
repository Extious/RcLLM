Excessive applications or even a single application of a high concentration (usually 50% or higher), may cause scarring.   \nThe most commonly accepted concentrations for use as a chemical peel are between 10% and 30%.   If purchasing a higher concentration, dilution may be required depending on needs.   \nSpecial care should be taken to avoid contact with healthy skin surrounding skin tags, warts, or moles when applying to avoid possible scarring and/or long lasting redness.\nAVOID CONTACT WITH HEALTHY SKIN OR AREAS WHICH ARE NOT MEANT TO UNDERGO A CHEMICAL BURN.  \nUSER ASSUMES ALL RISK OF DAMAGE OR INJURY TO SKIN.
