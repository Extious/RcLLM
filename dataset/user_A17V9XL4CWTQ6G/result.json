    "description": "The QMDTM Derma Roller Micro Needle Therapy SystemThe best proven treatment for Acne Scar RemovalStudies have demonstrated that rolling over an area of skin with a derma roller device, for around 8 to 15 times will produce hundreds of holes per cm2. Microneedling or \"Collagen induction therapy\" induces the release of growth factors. They stimulate the sinthesis of new natural collagen and elastin in the dermis. New capillaries are formed and all together, treatment leads to reduction of all scar types after therapy.  It is very effective for hard to heal acne, stretch marks and atrophic white scarringStretch marks, wrinkles, scars, cellulite, hair loss, uneven skin tone, acne scars, enlarged pores and photoageing are all due to a lack of collagen, so by using a dermaroller to replace the collagen you can help your skin renew and repair itself to a cosmetic level. Derma Roller skin therapy, is an all-natural cosmetic procedure which can be done in your own home, though we advise to consult with your dermatologist or physician. Also known as \"micro needle therapy\", \"non-surgical face lift\" and \"skin needle therapy\".It also helps ingredients and nutrients to be quickly absorbed through the skin, enhancing their efficacy so it can be used for transdermal medication delivery for Hair Loss treatments.***WARNING: Do not Share your Derma Roller -READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING AT DERMAROLLERQMD.COMBuy now with confidence with our 100% No hassle Guarantee - Click the \"Add to Cart\" Button Now!",
