    "description": "About Vitamin Serum: This serum will help stimulate cell regeneration and build collagen to diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots from both environmental and intrinsic aging. Additionally, it helps minimize the appearance of pore size, while correcting blemishes and blotchiness often associated with problematic skin. Often causes slight shedding of the skin which is rejuvination and renewal of the skin cells. This has Retinol which is the active ingredient in Retin-A and along with vitamin C, E and DMAE you will get great rejuvination and pore refinement. If rejuvination is what your looking for this would be the product for you. Our Vitamin serum will also assist greatly in reducing wrinkles. \n\nThis serum will make your skin tighter, smoother, and much more radiant in a very short time. You will not find a higher percentage of ingredients in other products. Most only carry small trace amounts of active ingredients, but TRUE RADIANCE offers higher percentage amounts for tremendous results!!",
