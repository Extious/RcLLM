    "description": "Sensation Non Surgical Face Lift helps boost collagen and elastin production, stimulates cellular regeneration, oxygenates skin cells, inhibits the production of free radicals, stimulates blood circulation, and most importantly, works deeply into the surface of your skin to make expression lines less noticeable. The Lift Powder and Activator create a mask that tightens and tones the sub-dermal muscles. This process is accomplished by a penetrating effect that reaches the sub-dermal layers of the skin and causes an increase in blood circulation. As blood circulation increases, you will notice a subtle pulsating effect taking place. This is a result of the muscles in your face contracting. Along with diminishing expression lines this regimen cleans the pores, lubricates, and moisturizes the skin. This all natural product is safe, and gentle enough to use everyday. This patented formula is specifically formulated to be gentle on such sensitive areas of the face.",

    "title": "Skin Obsession 25% TCA Chemical Peel for Home Use 1 fl oz (30 ml)",
    "description": "This medium depth peel uses Trichloroacetic acid and will improve many of the skin conditions that we all see (and wish we didn't!) when we look in the mirror. After peeling your skin will be softer, smoother, with improved texture and tone and reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage). Those are the differences on the surface of your skin. But the real magic is going on under your skin where collagen is being stimulated. This is what plumps up the lines and scars, yielding a smoother, more refined and beautiful complexion. The Skin Obsession 25% TCA Peel is a medium peel.  There is down time associated with this peel, between 3-7 days during the peeling stages where you may want to limit outdoor and public activities, but the results are worth it! With a long standing record for safety and effectiveness, this is the strongest peel we offer in our skin care line and one of our best sellers. This peel is for experienced peelers only. Due to the strength of this peel if you are new to peeling, you should try the 15% TCA peel first before jumping to this level of peel. This peel is suitable for lighter skin tones, darker skin tones should not use this peel as there is a higher risk of pigment issues with this level of peel. As with all of our products, a patch test is recommended to assess your particular response to the peel. This is a 1 fl oz bottle of peel solution in amber glass to protect the activity of the solution.  Ingredients: Distilled sterile water, Trichloroacetic acid.\n\nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",
