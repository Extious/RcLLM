    "description": "Mambino Organics&nbsp;Cellulite Body MassagerMambino Organics Cellulite Body Massager is specially designed to awaken the skins surface to help move fat-trapping fluids out while enhancing product application further into the skin. It works well, because it increases circulation flow, which helps break up the fat deposits. Stimulates blood and lymph flow Removes the body toxins Helps reduce cellulite Tightens the skin Why It WorksThe cellulite massage works on different levels. First off, it improves circulation. This will soften the fatty areas and release them over time. The kneading and gentle rubbing soothes the tension in the muscles and improves the blood flow. The second way a relaxing or cellulite massage works is through targeting the lymphatic system and draining the accumulated fluids often associated with cellulite. It can break up the fatty deposits and expel access water. Another way massage helps with cellulite is through the disposal of the toxins that have settled between the tissues. Often the fatty lumps that cause cellulite are due to your body toxins. A massage will work through these fatty lumps and eventually rid them from your body. Natural oils can also help improve skin's appearance and thus reduce the dimply affect.&nbsp;Studies have shown that a cellulite massage is one of the most effective treatments for cellulite out there. If you don't want to spend a fortune on surgery then a perfect alternative is a deep tissue massage. Take the relaxing approach and sooth those lumps and bumps away.
