Cleopatra used clay from the Nile river and the Arabian desert over 1800 years ago as part of her beauty ritual. German and Roman spas have been using clay packs and treatments in the spas they built 4 000 years ago. Many of these spas still exist and use clay even today. Pliney the Elder devoted an entire chapter of his Natural History to the many uses of clay for pimples black heads and skin tightening. Many famous naturopaths such as Kuhn Just and Kneipp have contributed to the revival of the uses of clay through their natural treatments for arthritus and skin ailgments.

    "title": "Skin Obsession 40% Glycolic Acid Peel for Acne, Scars, Age Spots &amp; Lines",
    "description": "Glycolic Acid has long been a first line product of the finest spas and Dermatology offices for improving the skin.  For those of you who have heard the term \"Lunch Time Peel\", this is the chemical used for it. Now you can do these peels at home safely and with fantastic results  After peeling your skin will be feel softer, look smoother, with improved texture and tone and reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage).  With a peel of this strength, a full course of peels (8-10 peels) are needed to see optimal results. This is a 1 fl oz (30 ml) of peel solution. Glycolic Acid is a naturally occurring chemical belonging to the Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) family.  Derived from sugar cane, this important AHA is the smallest of the fruit acids and is able to penetrate the skin, allowing it to effectively dissolve the \"glue\" that holds dead cells on the surface of the skin. The dead skin cells are what cause a dull, uneven skin tone, and the blocking of pores leading to blackheads and acne.  This dissolving action of the Glycolic Acid allows the dead cells to slough off, leaving behind a smoother skin surface with clear pores.  This also helps stimulate collagen formation under the skins surface which helps plump up the skin from beneath, smoothing out fine surface wrinkles and superficial scars. Our 40% Glycolic Peel is a mild glycolic acid peel and is suitable for all skin types and both beginning and experienced peelers. There may be some redness right after the peel, but generally there is not much if any actual peeling unless your skin is sensitive to the peeling agent. The 40% Glycolic peel is very safe when used as directed, but is a strong, professional strength peel (pH 1.5) and should be used only as directed.  As with all products, a patch test is recommended t0 see how your skin reacts to the peel. \nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",

    "title": "2.5 oz Microdermabrasion Crystals Exfoliating Skin Care",
    "description": "Microdermabrasion is a skin refining technique used in the finest spas and dermatological offices in the world. It works by using specially treated Aluminum Oxide crystals to \"sand\" away the top layers of the epidermis using machine that blasts the crystals against your skin. By stripping away the dead and dull layers of your skin, smoother, more even toned skin is revealed, skin with a healthy glow and clear pores. Using these crystals also enhances the ability of the skin to absorb other skin care products you use more fully and evenly.  Our Skin Obsession Microdermabrasion Crystals are the same crystals you would find in your dermatologist's office. Perfect for home use, these crystals are sold loose, and there is a very important reason for this. Many of the at home dermabrasion kits use heavy, lipid rich creams as the suspension base for the crystals. While this may be fine for someone with very dry tough skin, it can wreak havoc on sensitive, oily or acne prone skin! By shipping the crystals loose, each client can safely and easily add them to their favorite cleanser or cream, one for their specific skin type and one that they know works with their skin. This customizable format allows everyone to use this powerful skin resurfacing tool. The crystals can also be used with just water, to keep the system as simple and pure as possible! And as an added bonus, the crystals are not just for use on your face! They can be used on any part of the body where you need smoother, more even toned skin. Decollate, hands, elbows, knees, feet, legs, arms, anywhere where rough skin is a problem, skin that has been sun damaged and photo aged or just where you would like better absorption of product (Self Tanner, lotions, creams, peeling agents, etc). Your skin will feel like silk and we guarantee you will be thrilled! Item is sold by weight, packaging may vary.",
