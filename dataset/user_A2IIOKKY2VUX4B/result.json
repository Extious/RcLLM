    "description": "Organic argan oil has unique micro-properties that absorb instantly into the hair for deeper penetration, repairing the deepest damage as the natural micro-barrier protects from styling heat and UV rays. The result is radiant shine with a silky-soft feel for healthy, beautiful hair. Damaged hair occurs when moisture is lost, causing the cuticle layer to become dry, brittle and cracked. Argan oil moisturizes and smooths the cuticle, locking in moisture and returning your hair to its beautiful, natural state.",

    "description": "Organic argan oil has a unique structure that penetrates the hair cuticle, reducing friction and breakage during shampooing and provides a natural micro-barrier that protects from styling heat and UV rays. The result is amazing shine with a silky-soft feel for healthy, beautiful hair. How it works: Most damage to hair occurs during shampooing when individual hair strands are rubbed against each other breaking and cracking the cuticle layer. Argan oil lubricates and smoothes the cuticle layer reducing friction allowing hair to be cleaned while reducing damage.",
