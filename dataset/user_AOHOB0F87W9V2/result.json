    "description": "Quick and easy! This Incredible Add-On is a daily must to achieve a balanced and bright eye! Brush this tinted gel through your brows to enhance their color and shape. I think that shading and grooming the brows is essential to the overall look of the face. I call the eyebrows the \"forgotten feature\" because many women forget about them when it comes to their makeup. And yet they are a very important feature! They frame your eyes, making the eye appear larger and they balance the face when you have on lip color (if you wear lip color and nothing on the brows your face looks \"bottom heavy\"). This tinted eyebrow gel is a super simple way to groom, shape and add just a hint of color to your brows! For best results, lightly brush the wand through your brows, following the hairs natural direction. Say bye- bye to \"bottom heavy\" faces for good! Available in 4 shades: Blonde - for blondes, Fawn - for light and medium brunettes, Auburn - for redheads, Sable - for dark brunettes",

    "description": "RoC pioneered the use of retinol, the #1 recommended anti-aging cosmetic ingredient by dermatologists, and has spent years developing the next anti-aging breakthrough. This lightweight moisturizer combines RoC Retinol with an exclusive Resurfacing Serum to work together as one powerful system for maximum results. Together they stimulate skin's natural process to give you beautiful, younger-looking skin. Professional peels use chemical agents that strip the upper layers of skin, sometimes leading to irritation, discomfort, and redness. Results fade over time and additional peels are needed to maintain skin benefits. RoC Retinol Correxion Max Wrinkle Resurfacing System has been clinically proven to renew the look of your skin without harming skin's surface layers. After use, your skin will not only look younger and more vibrant, but will also feel dramatically smoother. In clinical testing, the dermatologist also observed significant improvements in the appearance of: Crow's feet fine lines, cheek wrinkles, uneven skin tone, overall skin appearance, sun damage, smoothness. Professional Expertise. RoC has been a leading French skincare brand for over 50 years, devoted to developing anti-aging products that guarantee visible and lasting results for healthier, younger-looking skin. Strong partnerships with dermatologists have contributed to our expertise in understanding skincare and developing clinically proven products, which are highly effective, yet suitable for all skin types.",
