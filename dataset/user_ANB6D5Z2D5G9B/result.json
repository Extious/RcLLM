    "description": "Glycolic acid (a.k.a. alpha hydroxy acid - AHA) powerfully exfoliates and helps bring new skin cells to the surface, which helps the complexion appear smoother. This product is a super high quality, completely non-comedogenic, 10% glycolic acid in a light feeling lotion which goes on clear and spreads easily. AHA+ also contains licochalcone, a licorice root extract which helps calm acne-prone skin. It is fragrance-free and dye-free.For the face:From Dan: \"I have always kept some glycolic acid around as a secret weapon. This is how I describe what it does: The Regimen (acne.org/regimen) will get you completely clear. Adding in glycolic acid will take clear to 'perfect.'\" When to start with AHA+: Perform The Regimen for a month before starting with AHA+. When you are ready to use it, you can either replace your nightly moisturizer with AHA+ 2-3 times a week or dispense 1/2 AHA+ and 1/2 moisturizer into your palm, mix, and apply every evening. You should notice your skin looking better and more even-toned and will undoubtedly get some compliments.For the body:AHA+ works alongside benzoyl peroxide to completely clear body acne. See The Body Regimen (acne.org/body) for instructions.As a spot treatment:If you see a zit forming, apply 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and allow it to dry. Then apply AHA+. Many people find that this prevents the zit from maturing. This works best is if you catch it very early.To combat irritation:When anything rubs against the skin repeatedly, such as a chin strap or helmet, it irritates the skin and can cause a breakout. Attempt to avoid or reduce irritation when possible. However, if you do end up irritating your skin, try applying AHA+ after your next Regimen application. This can help prevent an irritation-induced acne flare up.",

    "description": "Glycolic acid works as an exfoliating agent because of its high acidity but easy solubility. When placed on the skin as part of an exfoliating cream or gel, glycolic acid goes under the damaged upper layers of skin and destroys the 'glue', which holds dead skin to the surface. As this dead skin is chemically burned off, the other ingredients carry the individual flakes away and a water rinse neutralizes the remaining acid. The result is a much-smoother skin surface and a more youthful appearance. A secondary benefit is glycolic acid's ability to draw moisturizers into the newly exfoliated skin surface.",
