RoC MULTI CORREXION Night Treatment provides a comprehensive anti-aging solution to diminish the look of the most noticeable signs of aging and reveal new, younger looking skin.How It WorksThis breakthrough formula contains an exclusive fusion of age-fighting ingredients. Antioxidants help defend against the look of aging. Pure RoC RETINOL smoothes wrinkles and complements skin's natural process. Vitamin C helps rejuvenate skin tone.What Results Can I Expect?In just four weeks, dark circles are visibly diminished and skin tone and luminescence are noticeably improved. In just eight weeks, the appearance of pores and skin discolorations are visibly diminished. In just 12 weeks, the look of fine lines and wrinkles is visibly diminished.

The treatment can be used alone or under your regular moisturizer. For best results, use twice daily. You may experience mild tingling or redness during use. This is normal and should be temporary until your skin adjusts. If applying an additional moisturizer, use one free of Retinol.How Can RoC RETINOL Improve My Skin?Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.When you are young, your skin cells continuously renew themselves, which keeps your skin looking smooth. As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC MULTI CORREXION Night TreatmentAt a Glance:Diminishes the appearance of wrinklesImproves elasticityBrightens skinDiminishes the look of dark circlesImproves the appearance of poresAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties. Early use of Retinol products can actually help to combat fine lines and wrinkles before they become apparent, so your skin stays looking younger and healthier.Start Slowly:Using Retinol is like exercising. You don't start out running a marathon. Begin by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, you may begin applying more frequently until find the best routine for your skin.Stick with It:It is important to be consistent, as the benefits of Retinol are seen over time. If you happen to experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the products. Just decrease usage for a few days and work your way back up after that.Protect your skin:Whether you use a Retinol product during the night or day, always remember to wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.RoC: A History of Skincare ExpertiseRoC brand was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.
