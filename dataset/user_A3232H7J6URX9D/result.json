    "title": "Pineapple Pumpkin Enzyme Skin Peel- Enhanced with Papaya Extract &amp; Alpha Hydroxy Acids (Professional Chemical Peel)",
    "description": "Pumpkin contains a high concentration of beta-carotene, vitamins A, C, zinc, and potassium which fight against free radicals and damage from sun exposure. Pumpkin contains natural AHAs and enzymes (proteolytic enzymes) which encourage exfoliating properties, increase cell turnover rate and promote healthy production of collagen and elastin. Papaya and pineapple contains natural fruit enzymes (papain) and (bromelain enzymes) which gently digest keratinized dead epithelium cells on the skin's surface, while maintaing protective lipid layers.\n\nWhy Perfect Image? Many skin peels being sold today are not made in a professionally facility. This means they are not manufactured under the proper environments and no quality control, assay testing (activity of ingredients), micro testing (bacteria, yeast, mold, other Microorganisms), identity testing (Purity and Identity of Ingredients) and shelf life testing is conducted. This could cause a number of potential health hazards or permanently damage your skin if the product is contaminated. Contamination may occur during manufacturing or by the end-user after the container is opened. Without some antimicrobial properties, products can allow the growth of many different microorganisms. \n\nWe believe in incorporating natural plant extracts or organic ingredients which promote or aid in the healing, repairing, or protecting of the skin. Each ingredient is hand picked for its unique skin benefiting properties. We also incorporate natural preservatives into each product, as some studies have suggested using parabens as preservatives may cause potential health risks.",
