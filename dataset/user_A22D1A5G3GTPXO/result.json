    "description": "This New Watts Beauty Retinol Formula is stronger and offers the same great results as some of our other Vitamin A products but expect results much faster. The Popular Retinol Ingredient Enhanced by the Hyaluronic Acid and Phospholipids offers a soothing yet effective product. Vitamin A is proven to improve mottled pigmentation, fine lines, wrinkles, skin texture, skin tone, color, as well as your skins hydration levels and pore size. This suspension of Retinol (Vitamin A) contains a synergistic blend of active ingredients to help to soften and heal the skin with the most efficient and effective moisturizing system. Vitamin A has a molecular structure that's tiny enough to get into the lower layers of skin where it finds collagen and elastin. Please note that this product contains Retinol and may result in peeling and redness as the product helps to remove dead skin cells to encourage the new skin cell generation. It may cause sensitivity to light so be sure to wear sunscreen and moisturize the area daily after exfoliating the dead skin cells.",
