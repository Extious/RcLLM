    "title": "SAL3 Salicylic Acid and Sulfur Soap",
    "description": "Salicylic Acid and Sulfur soap provides keratolytic, antifungal, and antiseptic action. Salicylic acid alone is mildly anti-pruritic, bacteriastatic and keratolytic. This effect is due to the lowering of pH at the surface of the skin, improving the hydration of the keratin layer. Salicylic Acid and Sulfur in combination are synergistic, and support normal keratin formation. Bar soap is particularly convenient where larger skin areas - like on your face, or your neck, back, or arms, - are involved. Avoids the messiness often associated with lotions, or ointments. Has salicylic acid and sulphur been recommended to you for topical application? Has your family doctor or dermatologist recommended SAL3 soap because of your seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, keratosis pilaris, or body acne on your face, back, or neck? Or, you're dealing with the itching and worry caused dandruff, and you need an advanced soap? Salicylic Acid works as both a keratolytic and comedolytic agent by causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again by constricting pore diameter, and allowing room for new cell growth. We offer a large 100 gram, 3.5 ounces, soap bar! Ingredients: Active Ingredients are 3% Salicylic Acid and 10% sulfur. The soap builds a soothing lather, perfect for sulphur application. Suggested directions for use: Unless otherwise directed by your physician, work up lather using warm water and wash entire affected area with a fresh towel, or with just your hands. Because excessive drying may occur, start with one application daily, then gradually increase to two or three times daily if needed or as directed by a physician. If bothersome dryness or peeling occurs, reduce application to once a day or every other day.",
