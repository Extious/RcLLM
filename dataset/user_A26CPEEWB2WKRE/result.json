    "title": "MelanSol 100% Natural Sunscreen SPF 30, 3.4 Ounce",
    "description": "We formulated melansol 100% natural sunscreen SPF-30 as an extreme sunscreen for very fair skin during lengthy sun exposure and not for casual daily use. Because of the active ingredient, titanium dioxide, lies on top of your skin to safely reflect or scatter UV light, it will have a slight whitening effect when applied. MelanSol SPF-30 is broad spectrum--tested high for both UVA and UVB filtering. It reflects up to 97% of UV light and is recommended during lengthy sun exposure for skin that always burns and never tans. We recommend melansol SPF 10 for a daily wear sunscreen. All melansol skin care products are certified 100% natural by the npa. All ingredients have been awarded the natural products association (npa) green seal. The green seal certifies that each ingredient, and the way it was processed before being included in the formula, is completely 100% chemical free. MelanSol SPF 30 protects better because it has natural antioxidant technology. This technology soaks into your skin to detoxify free radicals, which helps prevent sunburn, sagging skin, wrinkles, age spots, non-melanoma skin cancer, and slow skin aging. The additional natural ingredients condition, hydrate, nourish, rejuvenate, and help skin repair. Peace of mind and optimum health is priceless, so use this soothing sunscreen generously all over your face and body, especially around your eyes. People love it because it doesn't burn their eyes. MelanSol SPF-30 starts protecting the moment it's applied, has a light citrus fragrance that dissipates in a few minutes, and is water resistant for up to 40 minutes. Check out our complete list of ingredients--not just the ones we think you will recognize.",

    "title": "MelanSol 100% Natural Sunburn Relief Gel, 3.4 Ounce",
    "description": "Sunburn and sun stressed skin is something you never expect, however, when it does occur, having effective chemical free relief that strikes at the heart of what is causing your pain and suffering is priceless. MelanSol sunburn relief gel is formulated with strong natural antioxidant technology that immediately soaks in and eliminates free radicals that have overrun your body's natural ability to protect itself from them. When the free radicals are gone, your pain, suffering, redness, and hot skin will greatly diminish. If you apply this gel as soon as the sunburn has occurred, you will greatly limit, or even eliminate, the amount of peeling you experience in the days afterwards. It contains a good amount of aloe, yet aloe alone is not enough. The 15 natural ingredients in melansol have been hand selected because they are natures best at controlling inflammation, rejuvenating and repairing skin, and eliminating the cause of your painful condition. This formula is also highly effective on sun stressed skin, skin irritations, contact dermatitis, skin inflammation, eczema, and psoriasis. The average sunburn product relies on chemicals combined with lidocaine, a topical analgesic that numbs your skin so you don't feel so bad. You might feel better, however, because you haven't eliminated the real cause of the sunburn, the excessive amount of free radicals, your skin damage will continue without being halted. A common sense sun care plan should always include an effective 100% natural sunburn solution and melansol is one of the best. Its convenient travel size tube is light and easy for any trip. Keep it on your boat, in your beach or sport bag, under your medicine cabinet, just about anywhere so it's ready to assist you when you need it. For increased hydration, use melansol sunburn relief gel together with melansol 100% natural moisturizer.",
