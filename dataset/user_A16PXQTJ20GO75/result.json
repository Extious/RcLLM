    "description": "John Frieda's total prescriptive approach to hair care includes outstanding brushes. Practically a frizz-ease platform, these stylish performers are tourmaline-ionic infused to give your hair that intense salon shine. Tourmaline gemstones naturally release negative ions that tighten the cuticle layer and seal in natural oils. Specially designed for today's blow-dry styles, they help smooth flyaways and reduce frizz while adding sheen. The shine secret is silicone, which lets the brushes flow smoothly through wet or dry hair. Use the paddle brush for a smooth, flat finish or straightening. The flexible cushion on the brush works well for medium to long hair that is tangle or breakage prone. The air-filled cushion will conform to your scalp's shape and act as a shock absorber during intensive brushing. Ideal for delicate hair that needs gentle styling. The broader cushion base will give you more straightening than smaller brushes. Designed with a slightly enlarged handle base, John Frieda brushes are easy to grip and hold while you style. Enjoy a professional salon-style experience with your John frieda.",
