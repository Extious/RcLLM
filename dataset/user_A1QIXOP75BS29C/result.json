As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC RETINOL CORREXIONDeep Wrinkle SerumAt a Glance:After 4 Weeks:- Skin is more radiant- Fine lines on face and neck &nbsp;&nbsp;are smoothed- Skin firmness is improvedAfter 8 Weeks:- Crow's feet are visibly &nbsp;&nbsp;reduced- Signs of photodamage are &nbsp;&nbsp;diminishedAfter 12 Weeks:- Deep wrinkles on face and &nbsp;&nbsp;neck are visibly reducedAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties.
