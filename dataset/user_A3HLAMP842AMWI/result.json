    "title": "3 Piece, Genuine Czech, Etched, Crystal Glass Nail File Set, Green/Blue-Small, Medium, and Pedicure Files",
    "description": "Green/blue, 3 piece nail file set. Made in the Czech Republic.  Spoil yourself with this top quality, double-sided, Czech, 3 piece file set protective sleeves. These are NOT made in China and contain no lead. They are made in the Czech Republic. They are also used by many celebrities. Set includes 1-small (3 1/2 inch), 1-medium (5 1/2 inch) for manicures, and 1-large (7 1/2 inch) file for cracked heels and calluses. If you should drop your file on a hard surface, it is designed to break in a blunt fashion. Other types of files that have not been through the tempering and hardening process can splinter and cause injury. The grit on the small and medium file is approximately 200-220 grit and on the large file is approximately 180 grit. Please note, the \"grit\" is etched into the crystal glass. The cheap imitations have grit bonded onto the surface of the file and wear down quickly. That is the reason these Czech files cost more. These are the best ones made! You get what you pay for! You'll remember the quality long after you forget the price.",

    "description": "Your health relies on the right nutrition, so does the health of your skin!Bel Essence gives you what nature intended and combines oils with beneficial properties to maximize your results in a luxurious cream. This all natural cream contains a mix of nine oils:Avocado, Grapeseed, Sesame, Almond, Argan, Shea, Coconut, Meadowfoam Seed and Kukui oils.Most skin care companies who promote their \"natural\" products take plants apart and recombine chemicals to create the benefits that occur naturally in plant oils. Natural plant oils contain important vitamins, fatty acids and anti-oxidants that help your skin repair, rejuvenate and retain its youthful glow.Avocado and Argan oilsare rich in Vitamin E, a powerful anti-oxidant that decelerates the effects of aging, and essential proteins and fatty acids necessary for collagen and elastin production to firm and tighten skin. These two oils also create a barrier that keeps moisture in the skin, preserving the dewy look you had when you were younger.Sesame, Grapeseed and Almond oilscontain Vitamins A (retinol), B and E which help rejuvenate skin, encourage the production of collagen and elastin, and reduce dark eye circles.Shea and Coconut oilsare powerful emollients, heavily moisturizing the skin and reversing damage from scars, burns and sun.Together, these oils will help skin regain its natural moisture balance and reverse the effects of aging.Bel Essence oils give your skin an instant boost in softness and suppleness,and with regular use will reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as restore your skin's youthful glow.",
