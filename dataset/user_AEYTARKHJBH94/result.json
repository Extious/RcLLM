    "title": "Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Solution, Paraben &amp; Alcohol Free / Multi-use - 60ml",
    "description": "Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in the extracellular matrix of human tissue. Topically applied hyaluronic acid forms an air permeable layer and penetrates into the dermis, thus boosting the elasticity and hydration of the skin. The protective breathable barrier on the skin locks in moisture which gives the skin a youthful appearance. The cuticular layer of the skin normally contains 10-20% water, however as we age it can drop to below 10%. Hyaluronic acid comes to the rescue with its unique ability to hold more than 1000 ml of water per gram of hyaluronic acid, which is a key factor in allowing the skin to retain more water. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption based on the relative humidity in the air. It is the ideal ingredient in skin care products as it adjusts to the skin's need for a moisturizing effect depending on the relative humidity of seasons and climate of an area. Hyaluronic acid also protects the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light which would normally cause sunspots. Currently there are two forms of hyaluronic acid on the market; one derived from rooster comb and the other derived by the fermentation of yeast. Watts Beauty chooses the natural source over the cruel rooster comb source. In addition, in the lab there is more control over exactly how potent a product is and is not waived by an animals diet, etc...",

    "title": "2.5 oz Microdermabrasion Crystals Exfoliating Skin Care",
    "description": "Microdermabrasion is a skin refining technique used in the finest spas and dermatological offices in the world. It works by using specially treated Aluminum Oxide crystals to \"sand\" away the top layers of the epidermis using machine that blasts the crystals against your skin. By stripping away the dead and dull layers of your skin, smoother, more even toned skin is revealed, skin with a healthy glow and clear pores. Using these crystals also enhances the ability of the skin to absorb other skin care products you use more fully and evenly.  Our Skin Obsession Microdermabrasion Crystals are the same crystals you would find in your dermatologist's office. Perfect for home use, these crystals are sold loose, and there is a very important reason for this. Many of the at home dermabrasion kits use heavy, lipid rich creams as the suspension base for the crystals. While this may be fine for someone with very dry tough skin, it can wreak havoc on sensitive, oily or acne prone skin! By shipping the crystals loose, each client can safely and easily add them to their favorite cleanser or cream, one for their specific skin type and one that they know works with their skin. This customizable format allows everyone to use this powerful skin resurfacing tool. The crystals can also be used with just water, to keep the system as simple and pure as possible! And as an added bonus, the crystals are not just for use on your face! They can be used on any part of the body where you need smoother, more even toned skin. Decollate, hands, elbows, knees, feet, legs, arms, anywhere where rough skin is a problem, skin that has been sun damaged and photo aged or just where you would like better absorption of product (Self Tanner, lotions, creams, peeling agents, etc). Your skin will feel like silk and we guarantee you will be thrilled! Item is sold by weight, packaging may vary.",
