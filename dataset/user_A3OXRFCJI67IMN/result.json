Antioxidants help defend against the look of aging that can be caused by skin-damaging free radicals. Pure RoC RETINOL smoothes wrinkles and complements skin's renewal process. And vitamin C helps rejuvenate skin tone.What Results Can I Expect?Dark circles and puffiness are noticeably diminished and wrinkles appear visibly smoothed in just eight weeks, revealing newer, younger-looking skin.Usage TipsApply in small dots around the eye area and gently smooth until thoroughly absorbed. Use alone or under makeup in the morning and in the evening.How Can RoC Retinol Improve My Skin?Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.When you are young, your skin cells continuously renew themselves, which keeps your skin looking smooth. As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC MULTI CORREXIONEye TreatmentAt a Glance:This advanced formula is clinically proven* to:Noticeably diminish the look of dark circles and puffinessVisibly smooth the appearance of wrinklesAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties. Early use of Retinol products can actually help to combat fine lines and wrinkles before they become apparent, so your skin stays looking younger and healthier.Start Slowly:Using Retinol is like exercising. You don't start out running a marathon. Begin by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, you may begin applying more frequently until you find the best routine for your skin.Stick with It:It is important to be consistent, as the benefits of Retinol are seen over time. If you happen to experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the products. Just decrease usage for a few days and work your way back up after that.Protect your skin:Whether you use a Retinol product during the night or day, always remember to wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.RoC: A History of Skincare ExpertiseRoC was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.
