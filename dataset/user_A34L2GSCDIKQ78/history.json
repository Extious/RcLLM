Exposure to light can degrade the butters natural properties. Our bottle helps to keep out light and keep the healing properties strong. Our butter is sealed in our controlled environment and will come to you just as you see it. It will not come yellow, rancid, gritty, or in a zip lock bag-like some others.IT'S A SHAME FOR YOU NOT TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF THIS NATURAL BEAUTY SERUM, WHEN IT HAS BEEN USED BY MILLIONS FOR CENTURIES.We guarantee you will be 100% satisfied and in love with your new skin or your money back.SO, EMPTY OUT YOUR BEAUTY CABINET, AND ADD MOLIVERA ORGANICS RAW AFRICAN IVORY SHEA BUTTER TO YOUR CART NOW AND \nENJOY BEING IN YOUR OWN SKIN.",
