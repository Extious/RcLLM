It is an excellent skin moistener and is used for aging skin, eczema and all forms of massage. It is also used to relax the muscles and to treat sprains, wounds, and colds. The unique properties of shea butter also helps prevent and protect dry skin providing temporal relief from irritation, dryness, and wind burned skin.
