RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Night Cream is formulated to work through the night when skin is believed to be most receptive.

Use alone or under your regular moisturizer.You may experience mild tingling or redness during use. This is normal and should be temporary until your skin adjusts. If applying an additional moisturizer, use one free of Retinol or Alpha Hydroxy Acid.How Can RoC RETINOL Improve My Skin?Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.When you are young, your skin cells continuously renew themselves, which keeps your skin looking smooth. As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC RETINOL CORREXIONDeep Wrinkle Night CreamAt a Glance:Diminishes the appearance of expression linesVisibly reduces even deep wrinklesMoisturizes skin through the nightLeaves skin smoother and younger-lookingAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties.
