    "description": "Help visibly firm, tighten and tone skin with this retexturizing formula. Rich in moisture and nutrients, this nourishing crme helps support healthy collagen and elastin to reduce the look of facial sag, diminish the visible signs of aging and protect skin from future damage. DMAE, also referred to as nature's firming agent, has been shown to firm skin, improve skin tone and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Alpha Lipoic Acid, also referred to as the universal antioxidant, is capable of protecting all portions of the skin's cellular structure and boost the activity of all other antioxidants. C-Ester protects the skin cells from free radical damage, helps reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, and helps firm the skin through its ability to support healthy collagen and elastin. Enriched with moisturizing Jojoba Oil and nourishing Vitamins A and E, this formula leaves skin thoroughly hydrated, nourished and firmer-looking. Ideal for those who are looking to visibly firm, lift and tone the face or neck.\n\nPlease Note: DMAE and Alpha Lipoic Acid are highly effective ingredients that will improve your skin's appearance. As with any new skin care product, before starting regular use, we recommend that you \"patch test\" for sensitivity on a small area under the ear below the jaw line to make sure you have no adverse reaction. If you have a reaction discontinue use immediately.",
