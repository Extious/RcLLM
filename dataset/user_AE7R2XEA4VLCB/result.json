    "description": "Please note that this stamper head needs to be cleaned and filed before using!Please also note that this stamper head is de-attachable from the holder which allows it to be replaced from time to time. This design will not affect the stamping process as the stamper head would not fall off if it's being used correctly. This stamper head was made from squishy Silicone so you do not need to push as hard as the regular rubber stamper when transferring the images onto the nails.Once it has been primed correctly, you will find that it's much easier to use than the regular rubber stamper!This Super Soft Squishy Silicon Rubber Stamping Tool Set transfers the design from the Image Plate onto your nail with no mess and no fuss.The scraper is used to ensures that just the right amount of polish is left on the design plate to achieve the best result.",
