    "title": "U-Lactin Dry Skin Lotion - 16 oz.",
    "description": "Trusted by dermatologists for over 15 years, U-Lactin Lotion is the solution for the driest, roughest skin there is. Dry skin can be caused by a variety of environmental factors, including cold, dry weather. When the skin loses moisture, it often chaps and cracks, thus reducing the skin's barrier properties. An additional symptom that occurs is winter itch, which often induces scratching, and which weakens the skin's defense mechanism further. We have successfully created a high-potency formula with a unique combination of superior therapeutic moisturizing agents: 10% urea, a humectant, and 2% lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy-acid. This unique formula allows the skin to absorb and retain badly depleted moisture and allows the skin to re-hydrate and soften without leaving a greasy residue. U-Lactin Lotion is Lanolin, Alcohol, and Fragrance free.",
