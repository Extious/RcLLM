Our emu oil is fully refined and contains all natural ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, and the essential fatty acids Omega 3 and 6. Please note that some producers sell a manufactured emu oil that has been clarified. This clarification process eliminates some of the most active ingredients of the product. Our emu oil is milky white, and each batch is analyzed to confirm that all essential ingredients are present at the natural concentrations. This oil is highly penetrating to the skin, and thus fully effective as topical treatment. InStyle Magazine featured actress Charlize Theron commenting on our product: \"I'm not big into styling products, but I use this emu oil to moisturize my hair.\"",

    "description": "Nail strengthener that, besides forming a protective barrier, prevents chipping, peeling and splitting of your nails. Instructions for use: Shake before use. Apply only to clean and dry nails. To start the treatment, apply a thin coat from the center of the nail down to the tip once a week. Let it dry and paint the nail with your favorite nail polish. After three applications, as the nail gets stronger, brush one thin coat covering the whole nail. Use once weekly. Protect the skin around the cuticles with cream. Caution: Can cause some discomfort on first use. If you feel pain, burning or persistent discomfort, remove it immediately from all nails and suspend its use. Avoid contact with cuticles and skin. Warning: Not meant for daily use. Keep out of reach of children. Keep away from heat and flames. Flammable. This product is formulated to be used once a week. Please note that, as is the case with any cosmetic product, excessive use can cause unwanted side effects. And again: if you haven't used this product before, do not cover the whole nail with the strengthener on first use. As your nails get stronger from week to week you can slowly start to cover the whole nail. This is especially important if you have very thin or brittle nails. Note: Retailers in the United States have to sell this product in the original box with correct ENGLISH LABELING AND INSTRUCTIONS printed on the cardboard box. Should you only receive the glass bottle without the box, please return the item to the seller for your own safety!",
