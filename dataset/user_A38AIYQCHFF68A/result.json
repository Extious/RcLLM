    "title": "IQ Naturals:Complete Glycolic Acid 30% Chemical Facial Peel Kit (professional set)",
    "description": "Glycolic acid peels have been the leader in advanced skin treatments around the world for many years. These peels come in different concentrations varying from 10% to 80%. Glycolic acid is perhaps the best-known of a group of chemicals called fruit acids or alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA). AHA provides an excellent way to penetrate the surface of the skin, resulting in drastic improvements of the skins appearance and feel. Glycolic acid works as an exfoliating agent because of its high acidity but easy solubility. Glycolic Acid goes under the damaged upper layers of skin and destroys the 'glue' which holds dead skin to the surface. As this dead skin is chemically released, the other ingredients carry the individual flakes away and a water rinse neutralizes the remaining acid. The result is a much-smoother skin surface and a more youthful appearance. A secondary benefit is glycolic acid's ability to draw moisturizers into the newly-exfoliated skin surface.Alpha hydroxy acids are an entire family of acids, which can be derived from fruit, milk or sugar. These are most widely used in skin care products as an anti-aging agent. Try it once and you instantly see and feel the results!
