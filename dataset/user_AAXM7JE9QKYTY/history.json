Brushes should be cleaned once before first use.Convenient Storage Pouch for Organization and TravelFor easy organization, the brushes are packaged in a black folding pouch that you can easily toss into your gym bag or suitcase. Extendable trays in the pouch offer additional storage space for extra items, like your favorite jar ofSHANY Mineral Eye Sparkle Eye shadow (Set of 40 Jars)(sold separately).
