    "title": "Watts Beauty Extreme Under Eye Cream Max - Dark Circles, Puffiness &amp; Fine Lines",
    "description": "This sale is for a 1/2 oz jar. Enough for several weeks. This product was formulated with the leading proven ingredients found in high end brand under eye creams to diminish dark circles and decrease puffiness. Chrysin is a granular product that releases into the cream leaving the small capsule behind. Do you know what actually \"causes\" serious dark circles? People think that dark circles are caused by hard partying, working late, being tired or simple allergies. But according to most research dermatologists, serious dark circles (the kind that make you look old, tired and exhausted) are about, of all things, the oxidation of hemoglobin (blood) in the capillary matrix of the peri-orbital eye area. These capillaries actually \"leak\" blood that begins to oxidize (through a process called hemoglobindegradation). creating a dark bluish-red pigmentation that looks distinctly like an ugly bruise. What does all that mean in plain English? Tiny little capillaries deposit blood around your sensitive eye area. The blood turns deep purple and you end up looking like you just went 12 hard rounds in a boxing ring.",
