    "description": "Dry your hair and improve its health at the same time with this  ionizing hair dryer from Conair. Built with a motor that's no louder  than a low office hum, this dryer has a sleek, comfortable design and  convenient, versatile functions. The most striking feature is the  optional ion disperser, which coats hair with a cloud of negative ions  to reduce frizziness, static electricity, flyaways, and dullness. The  dryer also features two heat/speed settings and a cool-shot button to  freeze styles in place. Designed to dry hair faster and maximize  volume, the diffuser attaches easily and has a wide, narrow mouth, so  the flow of air distributes to upper and lower layers simultaneously.  The unit's hinged filter removes for easy maintenance, and the  automatic shutoff disables power if the dryer falls or gets wet. An  out-of-the-way hanging hook simplifies storage and reduces wear and  tear on the cord.--Emily Bedard",
