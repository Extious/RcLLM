Hair extensions are a wonderful way to add highlights, thickness or simply make your hair longer. While they can improve your look dramatically, if they're not taken care of properly, they won't do much for you. These simple tips will help you take the best care of your hair extensions so that they will last a long time and you will get your moneys worth. 1 Be gentle. One of the most important things about hair extensions is that you have to baby them. When you are brushing your hair, be gentle. Without the proper treatment, your hair extensions will get damaged quickly. 2 Wash with moisturizing hair care products. This step is especially important if you are using clip in hair extensions because the hair will not get any of the moisture from the natural oils your scalp produces. Moisturizing hair care products will keep your hair healthy. If you are longing for shine, use a serum. Many hair care products that promote shine have a drying affect on hair.",
