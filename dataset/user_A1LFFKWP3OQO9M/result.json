    "title": "Acne.org 16oz. AHA+ | 10% Glycolic Acid Lotion",
    "description": "Glycolic acid (a.k.a. alpha hydroxy acid - AHA) powerfully exfoliates and helps bring new skin cells to the surface, which helps the complexion appear smoother. This product is a super high quality, completely non-comedogenic, 10% glycolic acid in a light feeling lotion which goes on clear and spreads easily. AHA+ also contains licochalcone, a licorice root extract which helps calm acne-prone skin. It is fragrance-free and dye-free.For the face:From Dan: \"I have always kept some glycolic acid around as a secret weapon. This is how I describe what it does: The Regimen (acne.org/regimen) will get you completely clear. Adding in glycolic acid will take clear to 'perfect.'\" When to start with AHA+: Perform The Regimen for a month before starting with AHA+. When you are ready to use it, you can either replace your nightly moisturizer with AHA+ 2-3 times a week or dispense 1/2 AHA+ and 1/2 moisturizer into your palm, mix, and apply every evening. You should notice your skin looking better and more even-toned and will undoubtedly get some compliments.For the body:AHA+ works alongside benzoyl peroxide to completely clear body acne. See The Body Regimen (acne.org/body) for instructions.As a spot treatment:If you see a zit forming, apply 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and allow it to dry. Then apply AHA+. Many people find that this prevents the zit from maturing. This works best is if you catch it very early.To combat irritation:When anything rubs against the skin repeatedly, such as a chin strap or helmet, it irritates the skin and can cause a breakout. Attempt to avoid or reduce irritation when possible. However, if you do end up irritating your skin, try applying AHA+ after your next Regimen application. This can help prevent an irritation-induced acne flare up.",
