    "description": "Anthelios SX is a light, non-greasy, fragrance-free daily use moisturizer with sunscreen that combines Parsol 1789 (avobenzone) and an innovative ingredient, Mexoryl SX (ecamsule) to help provide UVA protection. It is allergy-tested, PABA-free, suitable for sensitive skin and offers 24-hour hydration. Anthelios SX has complete broad spectrum protection. Anthelios SX contains MEXORYL&#8482; SX, the most effective FDA-approved organic filter designed to protect against short UVA rays (maximum absorption at 344nm) with high photostability, a key factor in sunscreen protection efficacy. This high photostability means the sunscreen will maintain a higher UVA protective ability longer and not degrade as quickly as other FDA approved UVA filters when exposed to the sun.",

    "title": "Skin Obsession 20% TCA Home Chemical Peel for face and body removes lines, sun damage and signs of aging",
    "description": "Our Skin Obsession 20% TCA Peel is a powerful and effective tool for resurfacing your damaged skin to yield the younger glowing skin you are looking for and deserve. This light to medium depth peel will improve many of the skin conditions that we all see (and wish we didn't!) when we look in the mirror. After a simple and straightforward process in the privacy of your own home,  and the peeling that follows, your skin will be softer, smoother, with improved texture and tone and greatly reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage). Those are the differences on the surface of your skin. But the real magic is going on under your skin where collagen is being stimulated. This is what plumps up the lines and scars, yielding a smoother, more refined and beautiful complexion. This is one of the most commonly performed chemical peels in medical offices and spas because it is one of the most effective and has fantastic results. With an impressive track record for safety and effectiveness, this peel is one of our best sellers.  If you are new to peeling, you may want to try the 15% TCA peel first before moving to this level of peel, though the 20% can be used by first time peelers.  This is a very safe peel when used as directed and is suitable for most skin types, however, some darker skin tones, particularly African American run a risk of post peel hypo pigmentation. As with all products, a patch test is recommended for all of our clients to see how your skin reacts. We include a full, easy to understand instruction manual as well as a free sample of our microdermabrasion crystals with each purchase.  This 1 fl oz. bottle of peeling solution is enough for approximately 8-10 peels done once every 4-6 weeks.Ingredients: Distilled sterile water, Trichloroacetic acid.\nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",
