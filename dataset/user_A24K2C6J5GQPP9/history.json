    "description": "Professionally formulated to even skin tone and effectively lighten pigmentation by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for producing excess melanin. Lactic Acid has been well-known to reduce the appearance of scars, age spots, sunspots, and discoloration associated with acne or photo-damaged skin. Lactic also promotes stimulation of collagen production, while increasing cell turn over rate, for a more brightened and balanced texture. Enhanced with natural skin lightening botanical extracts of Bearberry and Licorice which provide a more healthy and brightened skin appearance. Botanical extracts provide a rich source of antioxidants and vitamins, including Vitamin C and Vitamin E which promote natural healing and repair of damaged skin caused by aging and environmental factors.\n\nWhy Perfect Image?\n\nMany skin peels being sold today are not made in a professionally facility. This means they are not manufactured under the proper environments and no quality control, assay testing (activity of ingredients), micro testing (bacteria, yeast, mold, other Microorganisms), identity testing (Purity and Identity of Ingredients) and shelf life testing is conducted. This could cause a number of potential health hazards or permanently damage your skin if the product is contaminated. Contamination may occur during manufacturing or by the end-user after the container is opened. Without some antimicrobial properties, products can allow the growth of many different microorganisms. \n\nWe believe in incorporating natural plant extracts or organic ingredients which promote or aid in the healing, repairing, or protecting of the skin. Each ingredient is hand picked for its unique skin benefiting properties. We also incorporate natural preservatives into each product, as some studies have suggested using parabens as preservatives may cause potential health risks.",
