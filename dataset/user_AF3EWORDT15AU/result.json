That's why Thermal Creations Straightener offers optimal even heat distribution (EHD+) at high temperatures without damaging hotspots. The intensity of heat instantly straightens even stubborn curls and waves, so you can quickly glide the straightener through without leaving behind frazzled hair.Smart Contact PlatesThe Thermal Creations Straightener features smart contact plates that do their job without over-drying hair. They maintain maximum contact and provide a smooth, cushioned glide from root to tip. This process allows for more manageability, and sleeker results in less time. There's also a nine-foot professional swivel cord so you can reach every strand, even in the back, and a variable heat setting with digital temperature control up to 420 degrees, which makes it a snap to find the right level of heat for your hair type and style.Easy-to-UseAlthough the Thermal Creations Straightener is designed to give you salon-quality results, you don't have to be a salon professional to use it. This handy tool is a cinch to operate, and you never have to guess when it's done heating up, thanks to the convenient \"Ready-to-Use\" indicator.There's also a hanging loop for space-saving storage that helps prevent tangling of the cord, and a handle storage lock.
