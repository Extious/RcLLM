    "description": "ModelSupplies\n\nRapid BrowTM Growth\n\nFormula!\n\n~ This listing is for 1 bottle ~\n\nThe Original\n\n~Since 2003~\n\nAccept No Substitutes~!\n\nNOW WITH\nBiotin, Horsetail Extract, Black Castor Oil & Copper Peptides~!\nThe formula is now almost tan~!\nRapid Brow has worked since 2003, but we keep improving it~!!!\n\nRegrow overplucked brows!\n\nEncourage growth of new brows!\n\nI formulated this product after slipping with the hot wax and pulling off half my eyebrow! (I have plucked each individual hair ever since.) I was horrified, because your eyebrows really make or break your look. In acting, you learn that your eyebrows are KEY to conveying emotions (or not conveying). In modeling and makeup artistry, special attention is given to eyebrows to shape the face, emotion and theme of the show. If your eyebrows look good, you are more than half the way there!\n\nThis formula is an oily lotion that should be applied only where you want the hair to grow and in a very thin coating.\n\nThere have been no reports of adverse effects. There have been a few cases where it did not work on people. Like any product, nothing works 100% of the time on 100% of the people - (not even Min0xidil), but the success rate of Rapid BrowTM has been amazing~!\n\nJUST \"PAINT\" IT ON AT NIGHT\nResults usually reported in 3-8 days, but can take up to 1 month or longer, stick with it and be patient.  We have many repeat customers for this product. Rapid BrowTM has even grown hair where none has grown before in some individuals~! It also has worked on facial hair for men~!\n\nContains ingredients to reach and stimulate the hair follicles, clear congestion and seal for warmth to encourage faster hair growth.\n\nApply to Eyebrows only each night before bed - no eyelashes, please!\nPatent Pending.\n\nIf you have been using Rapid BrowTM for 2 weeks and see no results, keep trying! Especially if you have never grown hair in that spot or using to thicken your brows. Those results can take up to 30 days, but it does actually work!",

    "description": "Indian Healing Clay by Aztec Secret 2 lbs Clay How Aztec Secret Works Indian Healing Clay Clays have been used for centuries to beautify and refresh when used as a facial mask. Cleopatra used clay from the Nile river and the Arabian desert over 1800 years ago as part of her beauty ritual. German and Roman spas have been using clay packs and treatments in the spas they built 4 000 years ago. Many of these spas still exist and use clay even today. Pliney the Elder devoted an entire chapter of his Natural History to the many uses of clay for pimples black heads and skin tightening. Many famous naturopaths such as Kuhn Just and Kneipp have contributed to the revival of the uses of clay through their natural treatments for arthritus and skin ailgments. Aztec Indian Healing Clay A Brief History - The Worlds Most Powerful Facial The use of clay with apple cider vinegar can be dated back to the southern French priest of the16th century Kneipp and his natural treatments using clay packs and po",
