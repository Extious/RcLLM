    "description": "Our fabulous creation NuElle contains a cocktail of 25 well known flub busters that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction, like caffeine, L'Carnitine, Butcher's Broom, Bladderwrack, Ivy and many others. Formulated to work both on the surface and in depth, this revolutionary treatment has multiple performance that can be seen with the naked eye within 2-3 weeks. Firming on the surface, detoxifying on the inside, reducing water retention and fat cell clusters, while improving circulation and overall appearance of the skin. Directions: Apply in circular motions twice a day, on all affected areas, specially on thighs, buttocks, stomach - to help to reduce the appearance of cellulite. (Preferably two hours after eating or one hour before meal. Your body will only burn fat when it has none in the bloodstream.) This product creates slight \"sauna\" effect that may cause you to sweat more on the areas where the product was applied. Warning: Use only as directed. Do not ingest. Keep out of reach of children. Due to diuretic effect this product may cause, we do not recommend this product for use while pregnant. For best resits we suggest to use it with our L'or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed and Phat QR Body Massager.",
