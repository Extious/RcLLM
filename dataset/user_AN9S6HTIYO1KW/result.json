Use a thick highly pigmented polish for stamping. Work fast!If you take too long the polish will dry on the plate or stamper and you will not get it to transfer.If you are working fast and the polish does not transfer try another type of polish, some polished are extra quick drying.Be gentle when you apply top coat or you may smear your design.Please visit our store for our other exciting Jumbo Series 2 (#07-#12)!",
