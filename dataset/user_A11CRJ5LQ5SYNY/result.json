    "title": "Hairomega DHT Dht-blocking Hair Loss Supplement, 90-count Bottle, 45 Day Supply",
    "description": "The growth of hair is highly dependent on hormones, particularly testosterone. Notice how men are hairier? That's because they have testosterone. Any imbalances in those hormones, particularly testosterone, causes you to grow less hair. Hair loss is caused by excess dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. As we get older, the body turns more and more testosterone into DHT which causes the roots of your hair to miniaturize and stop making hair. Theres also less testosterone to tell your body to make hair! Excess DHT levels also cause prostate problems in men. It irritates and inflames the prostate, causing the prostate to enlarge and press up against the bladder, causing feelings of needing to urinate frequently. Hairomega has the ingredients to block the production of DHT and allow your hair to grow again, naturally! It uses a comprehensive formulation of herbs and plant extracts.",
