    "title": "Skin Obsession 25% TCA Chemical Peel for Home Use 1 fl oz (30 ml)",
    "description": "This medium depth peel uses Trichloroacetic acid and will improve many of the skin conditions that we all see (and wish we didn't!) when we look in the mirror. After peeling your skin will be softer, smoother, with improved texture and tone and reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage). Those are the differences on the surface of your skin. But the real magic is going on under your skin where collagen is being stimulated. This is what plumps up the lines and scars, yielding a smoother, more refined and beautiful complexion. The Skin Obsession 25% TCA Peel is a medium peel.  There is down time associated with this peel, between 3-7 days during the peeling stages where you may want to limit outdoor and public activities, but the results are worth it! With a long standing record for safety and effectiveness, this is the strongest peel we offer in our skin care line and one of our best sellers. This peel is for experienced peelers only. Due to the strength of this peel if you are new to peeling, you should try the 15% TCA peel first before jumping to this level of peel. This peel is suitable for lighter skin tones, darker skin tones should not use this peel as there is a higher risk of pigment issues with this level of peel. As with all of our products, a patch test is recommended to assess your particular response to the peel. This is a 1 fl oz bottle of peel solution in amber glass to protect the activity of the solution.  Ingredients: Distilled sterile water, Trichloroacetic acid.\n\nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",

    "description": "You have seen them recommended by Dr. Oz -Phytoceramidesare a revolutionary break-through in anti-aging! No need for painful injections or cosmetic surgery, takingPhytoceramides are clinically proven to help you look younger in a few short weeks!What are Ceramides? Ceramides play a central role in preserving healthy-looking skin. They are an important lipid component of the skin's membrane, where they provide protection from the elements and lock in moisture.The problem is that your body's production of Ceramides declines with age. That's bad news, since Ceramides make up 35-40% of the binding matrix that maintains skin's moisture balance and elasticity and protects the surface of your skin. Phytoceramides are plant based compounds that mimic the effect of Ceramides in your body.Our pure Phytoceramides are scientifically proven! One study using a group of people suffering from dry, flaking and sagging skin reported dramatic improvement in the look and feel of their skin. These results were verified by electrochemical analysis showing that 95% of participants exhibited improved skin hydration, elasticity and younger looking skin.We use only the purest and most potent Phytoceramides available so that you can be sure to get the best results possible. PhytoDerm uses the maximum recommended dose of 350 milligrams of Phytoceramides per day!Turn back the clock and get younger looking skin with PhytoDerm! Try it for 30 days and if it doesn't make you look years younger we will refund you 100%!",
