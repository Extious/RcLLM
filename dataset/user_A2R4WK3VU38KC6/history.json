    "description": "The Remington Style Therapy: Damage Therapy 1-Inch Flat Iron features plates covered with ceramic fabric for 50 percent less hair splitting and damage. Ceramic Fiber creates more styling surface than flat, slim plates. This added surface helps prevent hairs from rubbing against each other, thereby reducing a major cause of splitting and damage. This straightener reaches a top heat of 430 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds for fast, long-lasting results. An LCD display with temperature lock makes for precise temperature adjustments.Style Therapy: Damage Therapy 1-Inch Flat IronAt a Glance:Ceramic Fabric-wrapped plates for 50% less hair splitting and damageEasy-to-read LCD indicator display with temperature lock for precise adjustments300-430-degree heat range for fast and long-lasting resultsHeats up in 30 seconds; auto-shutoff in 60 minutes4-year warrantyMade with ceramic fabric, the Damage Therapy has a non-stick, low-friction surface.View larger.Heats to a maximum of 430 degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds.View larger.Remington's Therapy CollectionThe Remington Style Therapy collection--a hair care system that delivers conditioning properties while styling--provides solutions to combat irritating hair problems and works to increase hair health and vibrancy.
