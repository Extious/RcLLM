    "description": "Why Sage Shampoo for Dandruff?Sage shampoo is a serious solution for a serious problem. By taking advantage of a synergistic formula which works to solve the root problems which are the cause of dandruff, Sage is dermatologist-recommended for its ability to fight the causes and conditions of dermatitis. Made of the most organic and mild ingredients, the shampoo which holds our signature formula is great for all hair types, especially those sensitive to SLS or other detergents of that degree.The Formula/Benefits:Sage: Contains the most effective anti-inflammatory and anti-septic properties to combat dermatitis. Authentic and not part of the cosmetic nation which uses cheaper chemical alternatives, sage is also a natural benefit for those experiencing problems with hair loss.Spikenard: Works to restore pigmentation to the hair and assists in the battle against dermatitis. This exotic and luscious addition also works together with sage to promote hair growth.Rosemary: Rich in verbenone, this asset stimulates cell renewal of the hair follicles.

These give the shampoo moisturizing conditioner properties and helps with dandruff.Botanical Keratin: Naturally derived botanical keratin plays an important role in restoring healthy hair. Frizzy and damaged hair may stem from a lack of keratin, which this ingredient generously replenishes.The Holistic Promise:By utilizing only the purest organic ingredients for oil treatment, the shedding of dead skin cells is reduced and leaves a fresh shine. This shampoo offers a deliciously spicy aroma, and is guaranteed to turn shower time into a remedial and therapeutic experience.",

    "description": "Ever since you were a child, you probably heard the saying \"carrots are very good for your eyes.\" The Vitamin A one receives when eating a carrot may contribute, but there's more than that. Carrots have high levels of carotene and by using CO2 extraction, this is considered one of the most efficient ingredient to enhance appearance of mature skin. Rather than just lightening the outer layers, it works to stimulate cell growth and remove toxins underneath the skin provides a more toned and youthful appearance.Combined with aromatic Palmarosa and Marigold extract, blood vessel constriction (which affects dark spots) is adjusted and dry, puffy and sensitive skin is soothed and softened.Moisturizing properties benefit the skin overall while the prominence of blood vessels (a common cause of dark circles) is re-balanced. A topical treatment may not be enough for those with severe cases which require surgical intervention, but for everybody else Opulence is the holistic, natural solution for healthy skin around the eyes. Using your ring or pinky finger (for a softer touch), dab into the luxurious cream and apply gently into the area underneath your eye.",
