    "description": "The Toppik Spray Applicator will dramatically improve the results you see with Toppik from the very first application. This precision instrument allows you to spray Toppik on, rather than just shaking as before. By using this appliance, you will get an even more natural look...the fibers will disperse more evenly and be directed more precisely. Because of this precision, you will find yourself using significantly less Toppik, making this economical as well. Treat Specific Areas To thicken precise areas, try inserting the nozzle into your hair and spray gently. This will disperse the fibers more evenly giving you a fuller and more natural look. Fill Out Your Front Hairline The Applicator is perfect for filling out your front hairline. For best results, use it with the Toppik Hairline Optimizer, a laser generated template that allows for a perfectly natural hairline that replicates the growth pattern of your own hair.",
