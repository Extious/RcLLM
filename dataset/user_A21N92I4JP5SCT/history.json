This process may help reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and large pores, resulting in smoother skin with an improved texture and a marked reduction in oily areas, dry-skin patches, and blemishes.Gentle enough for daily use, the Facial Brush works with all skin types and has a replaceable microfiber head that is nonporous and bacteria resistant. The brush is also safe for use in the shower, thanks to its water-resistant, cordless design.One-Step Exfoliation, Cleansing, and SmoothingThis easy-to-use Facial Brush offers cleansing and exfoliation in one step. The brush's Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology works with your skin's natural elasticity to deeply cleanse and gently exfoliate. Two cleansing and exfoliating speeds are offered: a low-powered \"green light\" speed for gentle exfoliation (suitable for delicate and sensitive skin) and a high-powered \"red light\" speed for more rigorous exfoliation and deeper cleansing.The Facial Brush includes a timer that beeps after 20 seconds--the recommended treatment time for each area of the face (forehead, nose, chin, and cheeks). With the built-in timer, you'll never have to worry that you're working the skin too little or too much. For added convenience, the Facial Brush comes with a charger and built-in rechargeable battery.Works with Your Daily Skincare RoutineThe penetrative technology of the Facial Brush works well with your daily beauty products--from cleansers and scrubs to micro-dermabrasion creams. Simply hydrate or dampen your face with warm water, dot the product on each area of your face, and apply the Facial Brush as directed.What's in the BoxSonicDermabrasion Facial Brush, Counter Stand, 100-240 Volt Charger, two (2) microfiber bristle applicators, and a built-in rechargeable NiMh cell battery.",
