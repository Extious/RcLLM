    "title": "The Regimen: Complete Acne.org Treatment Kit",
    "description": "Hi everybody, I'm Dan. I suffered for years with acne and tried everything. Like many of you have probably experienced as well, nothing worked. So, I went to work researching everything I possibly could about acne and after years of trial and error I found a treatment routine that cleared me up completely using only common drugstore products. I made Acne.org to share my regimen with the world. Pretty much everyone who follows it closely gets clear--even people with severe acne. After 6 years of The Regimen being completely not-for-profit, I developed a line of larger sized, higher quality products to make The Regimen more affordable and effective for everybody. Here they are! -Dan",

    "description": "Generously sized 8 oz. certified organic jojoba oil. Jojoba oil will not clog pores. Quite the contrary, it makes many people's skin look great and helps keep their skin's oil balanced. Adding 5-6 drops of jojoba oil into any moisturizer will significantly increase hydration and leave the skin feeling smooth. It can also be used as an extra-light lip balm, to remove makeup, calm razor burn, or as a body lotion, hair conditioner, or massage oil. Please share your own use for jojoba oil on Acne.org.",
