    "description": "Color&#xFF1A;BlackThis is the new upgraded version. It comes with a slightly different package, and the eyeliner itself is sealed.It does better job in sweat proof and smudge proof. It's good for people who have oily eyelids. The new technology also make the eyeliner not dry out for a longer time after your first use.It's slim, so it can easily fill out any space between your eyelash.Suggestion: When the eyeliner seems like it's going to be dried out soon, you might put a little bit water on the tip or use a wet towel, and please put the felt-tip brush downward for a while (shake it if needed), so the ink inside can go to the brush. Do not recommend to use this kind of eyeliner over the powder or creamy eye shadow cause this will reduce its lifetime.",
