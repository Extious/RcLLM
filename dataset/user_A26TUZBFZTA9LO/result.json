    "description": "HEADLINEIs YELLOW Shea Butter Real Shea Butter? Oh Yes Indeed!Take the Ivory Shea Butter, add a root from the African Borututu Tree, and you have your Yellow Shea Butter. Simple!Our Yellow and Ivory Shea Butter are both Grade A, unrefined and organic, and are made by the same women and area in Ghana, performing the same amazing results for the user, and choosing one color over the other is a matter of personal preference.SUB-HEADLINE: Describe the ProblemWhy YELLOW Shea Butter?1. The consistency is harder than the Ivory Shea Butter and when applied to the skin takes a little longer to absorb. This is great news for very dry skin and eczema because it takes its time to penetrate the skin layers and keeps your skin moisturized longer.2. Yellow Shea Butter evens out skin tone and produces a very slight tan look in users with lighter skin. \n\nClinical studies have shown that Unrefined Shea Butter transforms the skin in as little as 4-6 weeks, into a softer, smoother, and better looking skin and it is truly applicable to many skin conditions. Raw Shea Butter is used alone or in combination with other natural ingredients, such as butters, oils and essences. Shea Butter is non-comedogenic (does not clog pores) so it is successfully used to naturally relieve acne.SUB-HEADLINE: Describe the ProblemOrder your 1LB of High Quality, Raw Shea Butter and start reaping its great benefits now!",
