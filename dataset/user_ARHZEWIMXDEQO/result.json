    "description": "AVIZAGE Vitamin C Serum 20% with Vitamin A & EAvizage Professional Vitamin C Serum is the simply the Best Vitamin C serum available today. One of the benefits of Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid is that it acts as an antioxidant by protecting the body against oxidative stress. Our professional Vitamin C Serum contains 20% Vitamin C (Ascorbyl Palmitate) for maximum benefits. While many 20% Vitamin C Serums have a short shelf life, ours is different. Because of the micro-encapsulation process, Avizage Vitamin C Serum is stable, giving it a longer shelf life and allowing for better penetration into the skin. This, in turn, means greater anti-oxidant and anti-wrinkle benefits.When used as a regular part of your skin care routine, Vitamin C Serum 20% can help to:~ Prevent and erase signs of premature signs of aging, including fine lines and wrinkles~ Protect against free radicals and future environmental damage~ Act as an exfoliant sloughing of dead skin cells~ Stimulate collagen production for firmer, smoother, more resilient skin~ Lighten and brighten skin for more even skin tone and an improved complexion.Avizage Professional Vitamin C Serum 20% plus Vitamin A and Vitamin E also contains Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid. These ingredients work synergistically to repair, protect, and rejuvenate your skin.
