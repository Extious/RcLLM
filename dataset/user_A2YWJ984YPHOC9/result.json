    "description": "What are you getting in your emu oil product? It might be the leftovers, or some of the potency just may not be there. Sure, it works, but it doesn't work as effectively as it should. Well, Pure Emu Oil Skin Repair extracted using the eClarified refining method is SUPERIOR to plain emu oil. The unique, proprietary process increases the moisturizing properties by 100%, giving you twice the power of ordinary emu oil. Because of this, Pure Emu Oil Skin Repair is quite possibly the BEST type of emu oil you'll find on the market. Olea Europaea (oil of olive) is a highly expensive ingredient, and we put it in our Pure Beauty Products. Go ahead and look at other beauty products. What's typically the first ingredient listed? Water, in some way, shape, or form. We use Olea Europaea instead of water, and while it's more expensive to use, it also preserves the potency of the emu oil that water will invariably dilute away. So, do you want an ordinary water-based emu oil product that works okay, or do you want an emu oil product that is 100% more beneficial using our unique process that not only preserves the inherent moisturizing properties, but increases their effectiveness by two-fold? The answer should be simple. The eClarified refinement process takes what makes emu oil great and makes it even better. Try our eClarified Triple Refined Pure Emu Oil Skin Repair, and when you see the remarkable results for yourself, you'll wonder why you hadn't tried it sooner.",
