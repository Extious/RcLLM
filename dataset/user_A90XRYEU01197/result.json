    "title": "Emu Oil Cream with Vitamin E - Super Strength, 17.6 Ounces",
    "description": "Emu Oil is highly moisturizing, a natural skin softener and has rejuvenating properties (it has been shown to reduce the depth and length of fine lines & wrinkles). Emu Oil has demonstrated to be the fastest and most penetrating oil into the skin, making it an excellent trans-dermal carrier for any other added moisturizers or therapeutic ingredients. AUSTRALIAN EMU OIL CREAM is a rich moisturizer formulated with Emu Oil and Vitamin E, to help hydrate and soothe dry and overworked skin and make skin feel fresher and smoother. Emu oil is rendered from the thick layer of subcutaneous fat on the back of the bird. Most commonly, it is used for the production of cosmetics but has also been proven to have medical properties, as an intensive pain reliever used in the treatment of chronic arthritis, strains, sprains, and muscle pain. It is also widely used as a wound healing accelerant. Emu oil is a good emollient and water-binding agent with anti-inflammatory properties. However, not all emu oil sold on the market today is of animal origin. AUSTRALIAN EMU OIL CREAM contains natural Australian Emu oil, obtained as a byproduct from farm-bred Emus that are chemical and pesticide free.   Free of impurities and residues, out Emu cream is a unique blend of oils specially formulated to provide ease of application, non-greasy feel & very pleasant smelling.   What makes us stand out from other emu creams? The secret lies in our unique formulation and getting the best grade concentrate of Australian Emu oil.  Now also available at larger size pump 17.3 OZ at our amazon store.  For more information refer to australianskincream.",
