Theirs was a path back to safer, natural ingredients proven to work together in effective ways. And so the J&#x100;S&#xD6;N&#xA0;(which means \"healer\" in Greek) brand was born. The&#xA0;J&#x100;S&#xD6;N&#xA0;team meticulously created&#xA0;body loving products&#xA0;staying true to the&#xA0;J&#x100;S&#xD6;N&#xA0;Code of Honor: select safe, wholesome, natural ingredients, rigorously test every formula to ensure safety and efficacy, never test on animals, and constantly innovate and improve. As one generation has given way to the next,&#xA0;J&#x100;S&#xD6;N&#xA0;products have remained on the path forged by the brand&#x2019;s founders, committed to discovering even more ways to offer personal care solutions safer for us, our families and our planet.",
