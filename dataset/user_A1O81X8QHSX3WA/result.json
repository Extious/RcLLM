    "description": "Nubian Heritage&nbsp;Indian Hemp &amp; Tamanu Grow &amp; Strengthen Serum - 4 oz. (119ml) Nubian Heritage&nbsp;Indian Hemp &amp; Tamanu Grow &amp; Strengthen Serum encourages healthy, new growth. The keratin, bamboo and garlic extract in Nubian Heritage&nbsp;Indian Hemp &amp; Tamanu Grow &amp; Strengthen Serum fortify and strengthen tresses, while hemp, tamanu oil and monoi oil condition hair and help prevent breakage. HeritageFor centuries, herbalists around the globe have applied hemp to the scalp to calm irritation. In Madagascar, Tamanu oil is revered for its natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties along with its deeply moisturizing and reparative benefits. In Chinese medicine, bamboo is incorporated into healing rituals to strengthen hair and promote healthy growth while naturopaths in the Mediterranean apply garlic extract. Naturally fragrant Monoi oil, a beauty secret from Tahiti, intensely hydrates hair preventing breakage. About Nubian HeritageIn 1992, fresh out of college without jobs, Rich and Nyema embarked on a personal mission to produce high quality bath and body products utilizing all-natural ingredients and ancient healing philosophies from around the globe. Nubian Heritage is the brainchild of these lifelong friends, turned New York street vendors, who simply grew frustrated with the inferior quality, high chemical content, poor selection and exorbitant prices of skin care products. Today Nubian Heritage has hundreds of all-natural and organic products and although they are no longer made in bath tubs or kitchen sinks, little else has changed. They are still obsessed with Fair Trade ingredients, Ancient Healing Philosophies, Community Commerce and Culturally Authentic Products.",

    "description": "Emu Oil 4 fl.oz. Emu Oil is a traditional Australian Aboriginal oil and natural skin and hair moisturizer. Our emu oil is fully refined and contains all natural ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, and the essential fatty acids Omega 3 and 6. Please note that some producers sell a manufactured emu oil that has been clarified. This clarification process eliminates some of the most active ingredients of the product. Our emu oil is milky white, and each batch is analyzed to confirm that all essential ingredients are present at the natural concentrations. This oil is highly penetrating to the skin, and thus fully effective as topical treatment. InStyle Magazine featured actress Charlize Theron commenting on our product: \"I'm not big into styling products, but I use this emu oil to moisturize my hair.\"",
