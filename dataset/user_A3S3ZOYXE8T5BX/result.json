    "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight the look of deep wrinkles with RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Filler.

Creases are filled to diminish the appearance of fine lines and re-plumped skin is softer and smoother. After four weeks, the look of crow's feet and deep facial wrinkles is visibly diminished.How It WorksThis breakthrough, dual-action formula is specifically designed to target wrinkles, with an exclusive fusion of hyaluronic acid and pure RoC RETINOL. Hyaluronic acid helps to immediately hydrate and plump skin, while RoC RETINOL is a clinically proven wrinkle-fighting ingredient. With daily use, the look of your skin is improved so that even deep wrinkles appear diminished in as little as four weeks.Usage TipsThis deep wrinkle filler is non-comedogenic (won't clog pores) and dermatologist tested. Use it once or twice a day, in the morning and/or evening. Gently dab a small amount of the product in the areas where you want to fill in creases and fine lines: around and under eyes, above and around the mouth, and on the forehead or between the brows.Use alone or under your regular moisturizer. You may experience mild tingling or redness during use. This is normal and is a sign the product is working. It should be temporary until your skin adjusts. If applying an additional moisturizer, use one free of Retinol or Alpha Hydroxy Acid.How Can RoC RETINOL Improve My Skin?Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.When you are young, your skin cells continuously renew themselves, which keeps your skin looking smooth. As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC RETINOL CORREXIONDeep Wrinkle FillerAt a Glance:Immediately:- Creases are filled to &nbsp;&nbsp;diminish the appearance &nbsp;&nbsp;of fine lines- Re-plumped skin is softer &nbsp;&nbsp;and smootherAfter 4 Weeks:- The look of crow's feet &nbsp;&nbsp;and deep facial wrinkles is &nbsp;&nbsp;diminishedAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties. Early use of Retinol products can actually help to combat fine lines and wrinkles before they become apparent, so your skin stays looking younger and healthier.Start Slowly:Using Retinol is like exercising. You don't start out running a marathon. Begin by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, you may begin applying more frequently until find the best routine for your skin.Stick with It:It is important to be consistent, as the benefits of Retinol are seen over time. If you happen to experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the products. Just decrease usage for a few days and work your way back up after that.Protect your skin:Whether you use a Retinol product during the night or day, always remember to wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.RoC: A History of Skincare ExpertiseRoC brand was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.
