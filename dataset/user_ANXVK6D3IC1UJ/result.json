In less than a week!Everyone's talking about Poppy Austin Argan Oil, and for good reason.Not only does it soften and hydrate your hair, as well as leaving your skin silky smooth, it's also packed full of fatty acids making it one of nature's most effective anti-aging moisturizers.Such is the interest in this naturally produced lightweight oil, celebrities such as Eva Mendes and Marian Cotillard (to name just a few) are describing Argan Oil as their daily skin and haircare \"secret\".WARNING: not all Argan Oils are the sameSadly, with Argan Oil's growing popularity, more and more companies are jumping on the bandwagon, using the Oil's name to launch sub-standard cosmetics. Most of these oils are completely fake, diluted or over processed in a lab. They contain just a tiny proportion of Argan Oil (often less than 5%), the rest of the bottle being made up synthetic filler ingredients and nasty chemicals.Poppy Austin Argan Oil GoldThe process of producing raw, organic, and 100% pure Argan Oil takes time. It is a manual system that has been carefully refined over centuries by the Berber women of Morocco. It is this exact process that produces each and every bottle of Poppy Austin Argan Oil Gold, deep in the heart of rural Morocco.This is our Grade A purity batch.
