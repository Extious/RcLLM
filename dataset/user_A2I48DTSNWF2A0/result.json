    "title": "Pre-Peel Salicylic Deep Gel Exfoliating Cleanser - Enhanced with Tea Tree Oil &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional)",
    "description": "A facial foaming deep gel cleanser that uses salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acid), to exfoliate the outer dead skin cells, cut through dirt, impurities, and oil beneath the skin's surface. It is specifically formulated to thoroughly cleanse and prepare the skin for the treatment of a skin peel. It can also be used as an aggressive daily cleanser to maintain benefits. Beta hydroxy acid works as an exfoliating agent to help accelerate the removal of dead, dull skin cells on the surface and to promote an increase in collagen production. Tea Tree Oil and Green Tea Extracts contain powerful anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-viral properties, and has been proven effective in killing Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria directly responsible for acne.",
