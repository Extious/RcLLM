As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC MULTI CORREXION Night TreatmentAt a Glance:Diminishes the appearance of wrinklesImproves elasticityBrightens skinDiminishes the look of dark circlesImproves the appearance of poresAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties. Early use of Retinol products can actually help to combat fine lines and wrinkles before they become apparent, so your skin stays looking younger and healthier.Start Slowly:Using Retinol is like exercising. You don't start out running a marathon. Begin by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, you may begin applying more frequently until find the best routine for your skin.Stick with It:It is important to be consistent, as the benefits of Retinol are seen over time. If you happen to experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the products. Just decrease usage for a few days and work your way back up after that.Protect your skin:Whether you use a Retinol product during the night or day, always remember to wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.RoC: A History of Skincare ExpertiseRoC brand was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.

    "description": "Glycolic acid works as an exfoliating agent because of its high acidity but easy solubility. When placed on the skin as part of an exfoliating cream or gel, glycolic acid goes under the damaged upper layers of skin and destroys the 'glue', which holds dead skin to the surface. As this dead skin is chemically burned off, the other ingredients carry the individual flakes away and a water rinse neutralizes the remaining acid. The result is a much-smoother skin surface and a more youthful appearance. A secondary benefit is glycolic acid's ability to draw moisturizers into the newly exfoliated skin surface.",

    "description": "Watts Beauty Retinol offers the maximum amount of Retinol per application of any over the counter cream. Retinol is the active ingredient in skin treatments, especially in wrinkle creams.  It's benefits are known to keep the skin young-looking, supple, smooth and clear of blemishes regardless of the imminent age factors. The Anti Aging effects of Retinol are being enjoyed by people from all over the world. Retinol deeply penetrates the skin and reduces the effects of free radicals which are responsible for accelerating skin aging in unbelievable degrees. Free radicals are unstable molecules of oxygen that cause wrinkles by breaking down skin cells. When free radicals are kept in check, naturally, the skin's aging process is held back. Because Retinol works below the surface of the skin, it is a very efficient candidate for removing deep wrinkles and fixing damages. It works by going below the outer layers of the epidermis to the areas of the skin that contain elastin and collagen.",
