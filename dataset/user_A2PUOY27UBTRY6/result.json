    "description": "Dr. Weston A. Price discovered High Vitamin Butter Oil in the 1930's. The pinnacle of his X-Factor discovery was the extreme synergistic effect between High Vitamin Butter Oil and traditional cod liver oil. \"One without the other did not do his patients justice, but the two together worked like magic\".\n\nX-Factor GoldTM High Vitamin Butter Oil is made from dairy oil extracted without heat from cows that eat 100% rapidly growing grass. The speed of the grass growth, timing of the grazing of this grass, species of grass, climate and extraction method are all important to make real X-Factor GoldTM High Vitamin Butter Oil.\n\nThe Blue IceTM Fermented Cod Liver Oil brings us back in time, when cod liver oil was truly a sacred food. The Blue IceTM Fermented Cod Liver Oil is lacto-fermented and extracted without heat. The fish are wild caught in the Arctic region.\n\nThe combination of these attributes provides our community with a pure, clean and nutrient rich sacred food.\n\nBlue IceTM Royal offers our community a nutrient dense sacred food blend of 1/3 X-Factor GoldTM High Vitamin Butter Oil and 2/3 Blue IceTM Fermented Cod Liver Oil.\n\nSafety warning from the manufacturer's website:\n\nThere are many discussions on the topic of food allergies topic found on the web. Some specifically discuss cod liver oil. There may be many antigens that cause allergic reactions. People who suffer from food allergies can react differently to any brand/lot/type of fish oil and maybe even individual packages.\n\nIf you or a family member suspects a food allergy please consult your physician prior to using any and all fish oil/ cod liver oil products. There are discussions indicating that if one has a shellfish allergy they should never take a cod liver oil or other products from the sea such as some calcium supplements.",
