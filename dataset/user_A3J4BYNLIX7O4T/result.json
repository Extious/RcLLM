Cleaning your Makeup Brushes Unclean makeup brushes transfer old makeup, germs, and bacteria to your skin each time you use them. Ideally, you should wash them once a week, and here&#x2019;s the best way how:   Run the bristles of makeup brush under warm running water. Careful not to get the ferrules and handles wet.  Apply a drop of gentle shampoo or clarifying cleanser to bristles and work into a light lather.  Rinse bristles thoroughly under warm, running water.  Continue rinsing until water runs clear.  Use a cloth to absorb excess water and reshape the bristles  Lay your makeup brushes flat or &#x201C;handles up&#x201D; to air dry",

    "description": "Product Description\nIZUNAMI KTX is an exclusive design specifically created for Keratin Treatments. KTX's titanium plates prevent static electricity while smoothing and coating hair cuticles to revitalize dry and damaged hair. This titanium metal is not only scratch resistant and durable but is exceptionally lightweight. Titanium is a metallic element best known for its high strength and low density. While very lightweight, it provides superior heat conductibility, exceptionally resistant to chemical corrosion, and can withstand high heat. In addition to its ability to inhibit bacteria build ups, its biocompatible nature is non toxic and non allergenic. Two independent heat sensors regulate the temperature of each plate simultaneously so that both plates maintain consistent temperature without overheating. With the use of Kyocera MCH Heater, our advanced flash heating technology ensures immediate heat to reach its desired temperature in shortest time. REQDTM (Rapid Engagement and quick disengagement) technology enables multiple sessions of heat recovery in less than a second to maintain the set temperature without heat fluctuation. Moisture molecules in hair are reduced in size, enhancing their natural properties to give shiny, healthy results.",
