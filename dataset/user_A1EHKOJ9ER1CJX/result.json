Rinse.\n\nSIZE : Net Wt. 10.1 fl oz / 300 ml\n\n\nSulfate-Free Shampoo\nMost every other shampoo on the market today uses either sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, or a similar sulfate-based surfactant as a primary cleansing ingredient. These ingredients are known irritants, drying to the hair and can aggressively strip hair color. While a few others may claim it, all PRAVANA shampoos are truly Sulfate-free. The result: hair color lasts longer, and without risk or irritation to the user.",
