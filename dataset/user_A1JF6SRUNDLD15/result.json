    "description": "RAW African Black Soap African traditional black soap is one of the most beneficial yet unheard of soaps you will ever find. Made from dried plantain skins, palm leaves, cocoa pod powder, and kernel oil for an all-natural cleansing process. Plantains skins are largely what make this soap so effective. Plantain is a fruit that grows in Africa and South America that looks similar to a banana, except it is much larger and tastes altogether different. You can find plantains at many ethnic or international grocery stores. It is a natural source of vitamins A, E and iron. When black soap is made, the skin of the plantain is gingerly dried to a precise texture under the sun. Afterwards it is roasted in a clay oven. The heat must be constant in order to achieve the perfect brownish black color, texture and smell. Afterwards, cocoa pod powder is added. Cocoa pod is the shell of the cocoa fruit and also has natural healing properties",
