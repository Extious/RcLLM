    "description": "New and improved formula as of June 15th, 2014. This serum now contains an eyelash growth peptide and is in most eyelash growth serums. This formula is not made with any chemicals and is greasy. A lot goes a long way. I apply it by blinking on to the wand. All natural formula made with ingredients known to promote the growth of lashes, make them thicker, healthier and darker. This product now comes with a doe foot applicator. Apply to your lashes and try to get to the base. You can apply it with a qtip, a fingertip or any small brush as well. Make sure you remove all eye make-up before bed because it can dry out lashes. Then apply a nice coat of our special formula and make sure you get close to the roots. Sleep with it on your lashes and dream of sexier, more dramatic lashes. Remove the treatment with a gentle cleanser in the morning because the oils can attract dust. Made with coconut oil, vitamin e, aloe oil, almond oil, castor oil, and beeswax. Please note that this product does contain almond oil and coconut oil so if you are sensitive to peanuts it might not be the right product for you. Your lashes recycle every two weeks. Your lashes will still recycle this product helps them become more lush until they recycle and it helps new lashes come in healthier.\nThese statements have not been evaluated by the FDA, and this product is not intended to diagnose, treat or cure any disease.",
