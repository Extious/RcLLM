Several weeks before it emerges, bacteria, dead skin cells and oil bond beneath the skin to form a blemish. Natural Results Acne Treatment System helps put a stop to the acne cycle by striking back - first at the core of a pimple and then across the surface. Finally, it helps prevent the development of new breakouts so skin stays clear, naturally. Our Easy-to-Use 3-Step System: Contains everything you need to stop the acne cycle and get consistently clear skin; Contains effective acne medicine without a prescription; Provides continuous acne control with daily use.",
