Ions create strong, long-lasting and luxurious curls.  Help condition, soften and make hair shinier while adding volume and reducing frizz. The large and jumbo rollers in this product share the exact same size plastic roller shield. The difference is the Jumbo roller will have a thicker foam around the roller than the large size. This is why the Rollers say Large/Jumbo&#x201D;. You will receive 12 rollers that will say Large/Jumbo. You will need to look at foam thickness to differentiate between the 6 Large and 6 Jumbo. Note : The red LED light comes on only in the IONIC Steam setting.  Unit will work even without the red LED light turning on because steam will start coming out of the unit.",

Known to be one of the most oxidant stable oils in the world, marula oil is highly recommended to soften skin and balance moisture levels. Ideally used after a spritz of distillate water, daily usage plumps skin cells and drastically slows down damage to collagen. Growing wild throughout southern Africa, this emollient oil is collected from intoxicatingly sweet marula fruits. Craved by monkeys, elephants and humans alike, these fruits are often made into jams and juices. But as sweet as the fruit is, the real prize for many lies inside. The tough shell of marula's seed protects the precious oil making those who can't wait to indulge themselves work very hard for it. Each shell must be crushed by hand using a heavy rock. Once winnowed away, the seeds are sun dried while our Namibian collectors await transport of the seeds to the mill. Once pressed, this precious oil is flown off to Shea Terra Organics in its most desired virgin state.\n\nDescription: 100% Pure, Natural & Virgin. Skin dying for a boost of anti-oxidants? Bring it back to life with one of the most anti-oxidant rich oils in the world. Put lustre into dull, dry skin while balancing oily skin. Apply to cuticles to get rid of cracking.",
