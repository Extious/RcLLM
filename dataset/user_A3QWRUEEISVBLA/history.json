You may store serum in a refrigerator. Always store unopened bottles in the refrigerator.\n\nSERUM CONSISTENCY:\nNuFountain Fresh Cosmetics specializes in fresh-made serums using l-ascorbic acid which is water soluble. To effectively penetrate to your cellular level where it repairs free-radical damage, we do not use any oils, thickeners or unnecessary ingredients that make it thick and slow absorption. Our serums are very thin and since they are made fresh when ordered (free from oxidation which makes serums turn yellow, amber or brown and develop a strong odor), they are clear and appear water-like. This is what a great l-ascorbic acid serum should look and feel like. We produce fresh, honest l-ascorbic acid serums that are clear, and absorb immediately into your skin.\n\nSPECIAL OFFER: Purchase 2 bottles -- get a 3rd bottle FREE -- Enter the total number of bottle you want (such as \"3\") and the price of 1 bottle will be deducted when you checkout -- and you can mix and match with other NuFountain serums.\n\nORDERING LARGER QUANTITIES: To get 6 bottles (total), enter \"6\" for quantity and you will get the price of 2 bottles discounted at checkout. You get 1 bottle discounted for every three ordered and there is no limit.",
