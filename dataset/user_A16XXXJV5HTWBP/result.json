If the hair is coarser and more resistant, using the SpeedDry Nozzle, with its narrower opening that forces condensed air onto the hair, will help accelerate the drying process. Conversely, if hair is finer and more delicate, such as chemically-treated hair, use the nozzle for drying and styling without damage.",
