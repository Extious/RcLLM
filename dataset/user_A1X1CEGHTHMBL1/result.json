    "description": "Beenigma Bee Venom Cream is the Anti-Aging sensation from New Zealand.  Beenigma Bee Venom Cream uses only the finest Active New Zealand Bee Venom and 20+ Manuka Honey.  Rejuvenate the youthful appearance of your skin to be smooth, glowing, and radiant with Beenigma Bee Venom Cream.  Beenigma Face Cream does not need to be washed away.  The skin reacts to the Bee Venom found in Beenigma as if it's been lightly stung, triggering an increase in our body's production of wrinkle-smoothing collagen and elastin to lift, plump and tighten the skin. Don't worry, this does not hurt at all... In fact, you may feel a mild tingling and the result is an anti-aging and rejuvenating effect that makes your skin more radiant and youthful by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Bee Venom has the ability to work within the epidermis and dermal levels of the skin to deeply nourish. It is comprised of 21 naturally occurring components such as replenishing proteins, peptides, amino acids, and key enzymes.  ***Please Note: DO NOT use this product if you have a known bee allergy.***",
