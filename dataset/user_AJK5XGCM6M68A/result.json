    "description": "With one swift spritz of our Moroccan Rose Water Ester C Facial Mist, you'll luxuriate your skin and bathe yourself in a sea of silky roses. 17th century herbalist, Nicholas Culpeper, used red roses to strengthen the heart, for cooling and astringent benefits to the skin, and to soothe headaches and tired eyes. Our mist immerses you in beautifully fragrant Moroccan rose water distilled from the best damask roses, to heal and tone while improving circulation. Ester C stimulates cell renewal, promotes collagen, improves skin tone and elasticity, as well as lightens dark spots. Calm, hydrate and renew your skin with our sensual facial mist. Treat yourself to the absolute finest. \n\nMost vitamin C products are made with degradable vitamin C. Although they are promoted to assist skin collagen they actually do more harm than good. Ester-C company, famous for their highly digestible internal vitamin formulas, has used the same technology to develop a topical form of Ester-C which remains stable in skin care applications. May feel a burning sensation when using Ester-C. Varies for skin type.",
