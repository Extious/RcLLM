    "description": "Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) is used as an intermediate to deep peeling agent in concentrations ranging from 15-30%. Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA) is a well-known chemical acid which has been used for years by Dermatologists and Surgeons to improve the texture of your skin by removing the damaged outer layers and revealing the new smooth skin underneath. \n\n* TCA peels cost $300.00 - $1000.00 per peel at your local Dermatologists or Estheticians office. Save thousands of dollars with this product and safely take years off of your face at the same time. Get the same results you can get at a high end spa in the privacy of your own home. DO NOT being with the 20% or 30% TCA unless you have used 15% several times successfully. If this is your first peel, Ideal Peel Solutions recommends that you start with the lightest strength. We offer several strengths - 15%, 20%, 30%. NOTE: 20%, 30% are strong peels and should be used by individuals who have previously used 15% without any problems.\n\nFull list of benefits of each active ingredients is listed at our website.",

    "title": "Skin Obsession 25% TCA Chemical Peel for Home Use 1 fl oz (30 ml)",
    "description": "This medium depth peel uses Trichloroacetic acid and will improve many of the skin conditions that we all see (and wish we didn't!) when we look in the mirror. After peeling your skin will be softer, smoother, with improved texture and tone and reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage). Those are the differences on the surface of your skin. But the real magic is going on under your skin where collagen is being stimulated. This is what plumps up the lines and scars, yielding a smoother, more refined and beautiful complexion. The Skin Obsession 25% TCA Peel is a medium peel.  There is down time associated with this peel, between 3-7 days during the peeling stages where you may want to limit outdoor and public activities, but the results are worth it! With a long standing record for safety and effectiveness, this is the strongest peel we offer in our skin care line and one of our best sellers. This peel is for experienced peelers only. Due to the strength of this peel if you are new to peeling, you should try the 15% TCA peel first before jumping to this level of peel. This peel is suitable for lighter skin tones, darker skin tones should not use this peel as there is a higher risk of pigment issues with this level of peel. As with all of our products, a patch test is recommended to assess your particular response to the peel. This is a 1 fl oz bottle of peel solution in amber glass to protect the activity of the solution.  Ingredients: Distilled sterile water, Trichloroacetic acid.\n\nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",
