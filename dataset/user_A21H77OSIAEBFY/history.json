Cleaning your Makeup Brushes Unclean makeup brushes transfer old makeup, germs, and bacteria to your skin each time you use them. Ideally, you should wash them once a week, and here&#x2019;s the best way how:   Run the bristles of makeup brush under warm running water. Careful not to get the ferrules and handles wet.  Apply a drop of gentle shampoo or clarifying cleanser to bristles and work into a light lather.  Rinse bristles thoroughly under warm, running water.  Continue rinsing until water runs clear.  Use a cloth to absorb excess water and reshape the bristles  Lay your makeup brushes flat or &#x201C;handles up&#x201D; to air dry",
