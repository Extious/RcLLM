    "description": "Modernize the way you clean up!  You wouldn't eat dinner without first washing your hands, so don't use your Beautyblender repeatedly without first cleaning it.  Hygiene is a must when it comes to keeping you skin fresh and healthy.  Oil and dirt from your face will stay on your applicators if you don't take a moment to properly clean them.  That's why Silva and Lorenz offer Blendercleanser, the perfect hygienic companion for your Beautyblender.  Blendercleanser is a lightly lavender-scented cleanser that's free of dyes and skin irritants.  It's soothing soy-based, low-suds formula breaks down rapidly and fun to use.  Soy has the added benefit of being one of nature's finest moisturizers and lavender is a natural anti-microbial, so by all means, clean up with class and do it often.",
