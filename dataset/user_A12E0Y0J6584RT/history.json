The Eraser, however, is specially designed to target them with strong medicine that penetrates your skin's pores. It not only helps clear up the blackheads you have now, it also prevents new ones from forming. The result? Less blackheads today and tomorrow for a smoother, brighter skin.Effective and Easy to UseThe Eraser features an ergonomic, user-friendly design that makes it easy to grab blackheads and start erasing. Simply reach for one of the included medicated pads (use a new one every time you wash), run it under some water, place it on the surface of the eraser, and twist to turn on. The Eraser gently vibrates to exfoliate dead surface skin and remove dirt and oil more effectively. The foaming medicated pads, containing Clean and Clear's exclusive blackhead dissolving serum with salicylic acid, ensure a deep clean so your skin will feel refreshed. For added convenience, the cordless Eraser runs on one \"AA\" battery (included).Soft, Smooth SkinThe Eraser's foaming action can help clear up problem areas. It also makes it easier to focus on parts of you face where you're more likely to get blackheads--like on or around the nose, along the jawline, or on the chin. After only one use, your skin will feel softer and smoother. And as part of a healthy skin regimen, the Eraser lets you put your best face forward, each and every day.About Clean and ClearPart of Johnson and Johnson's family of health and personal care companies, Clean and Clear offers acne skin care products, treatments, and medications to leave skin looking healthy, clean, and radiant.
