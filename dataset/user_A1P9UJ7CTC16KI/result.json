    "description": "Pure, light and glowing.... is the essence of this creme. Pregnancy-safe age defying treatment. This days more and more women enter motherhood being over 30, and even 40 and most of us are concerned with aging. Time stands still for noone, even mom-to be. So how do we defy process of aging safely during pregnancy, without harmful chemicals and ingredients that are not welcome for mother-to be?\n\nQ*Lumiere was designed to address this concern. Lightweight pampering formula containing unique cocktail of fruit extracts and rich in Ellagic acid, an antioxidant found in raspberries, strawberries and cranberries, protects against ultraviolet damage by blocking production of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes that break down collagen. Spirulina, Cucumber and Sea Kelp deliver continuous hydration and keep your skin supple and fresh. Watermelon, rich in Vitamin C and naturally occurring carbohydrates and amino acids supports the UV-stressed immune system of the skin and can be used to prevent photo-aging. This extract also helps to protect the skin from every day toxins and promotes cell-renewal. Silk Amino Acids (18 types) and Co Q10 enzyme aid in moisture loss, cellular renewal and collagen production as well as support cell energy giving you silky velvet, smooth glowing skin. Reishi mushroom carries Asiatic Acid to the cells for damage restoration, fading of sun spots and damage, wrinkle reduction, and boosting of cellular hydration.",
