    "description": "STOP Painting Your Lashes...TUBE Them! Blinc is the worlds first mascara innovation to form tiny water-resistant tubes around your lashes that stay on better than waterproof mascaras yet come off easily without the need for a makeup remover. &#x2022; Blinc mascara is not an oil-based paint like traditional mascaras, which means it cannot smudge, run, clump or flake into your eyes - making it ideal for people with sensitive eyes and those that wear contacts. &#x2022; Blinc is applied like a regular mascara, however once it sets, tiny tubes will form around your lashes providing both volume and length. &#x2022; Blinc does not penetrate your skin or your lashes, unlike most mascaras. &#x2022; Blinc lasts 2 to 3 times longer because it does not dry out as fast as traditional oil-based paint mascaras. &#x2022; Blinc will stay on until you are ready to take it off, even if you were to cry or rub your eyes, that is why Brides Magazine ranked Blinc as a top 10 mascara to wear for your wedding day.All Make Up Sales are Final - No Returns or Exchanges.",
