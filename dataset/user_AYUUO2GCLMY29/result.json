    "description": "The BHA+ peel is a combination of chemicals in a single peel. This peel contains salicylic acid, lactic acid and resorcinol (another skin-peeling chemical) which together constitute a very adjustable peel which lends itself well to repeat applications. It is similar in many ways to Skin Laboratory's other peels, but there are certain important differences. The BHA+ peel penetrates more deeply into the epidermal layers of the skin and is gentler than chemical peels. Typically, there is no downtime and most clients are able to return to their normal activities soon after receiving treatment. Because they are gentler, however, several treatments may be required to achieve the best results.This peel is not recommended for people with sensitive skin, or those new to chemical peels. Skin Laboratory's Salicylic/20 is a great peel to get your skin accustomed to chemicals peels with less risk of irritation.Choosing the Best Peel:Skin Laboratory offers different types of chemical peels to help with things like exfoliating the skin and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles. If you are looking for the BEST peel for your condition, the following list will help you select it. The peels effectiveness is not limited to these conditions:Glycolic:Eczema &amp; Dermatitis, Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles, Razor Bumps, Stretch Marks and General Toning &amp; TextureLactic:Actinic Keratosis, Dark Circles Under Eyes, Dry Skin, Eczema &amp; Dermatitis, Melasma, Psoriasis, Razor Bumps, Scarring, Sensitive Skin, Stretch Marks, Sun Damage and General Toning &amp; TextureSalicylic:Acne, Acne Scars, Adolescent Skin, Large Pores &amp; Blackheads, Oily Skin, Psoriasis, Razor Bumps and WartsBHA+:Acne, Adolescent Skin, Large Pores &amp; Blackheads, Oily Skin, Psoriasis and WartsHQ+:Acne Scars, Actinic Keratosis, Melasma, Oily Skin and Scarring",
