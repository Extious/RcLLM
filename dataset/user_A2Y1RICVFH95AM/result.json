Its suede texture is sensual to the touch and its unique curves fit the contours of your face, leaving your make up dazzling and undetectable. Beauty Blenderis latex free, non-allergenic and odor free.  \n\nHow to use\n\nimage-howto.jpgBlend your way to a flawless face! Seeing make up is the first sign of an amateur application. Beauty Blender was created without edges in order to eliminate visible lines and streaks. So go ahead, experiment fearlessly with your Beauty Blender and discover the many ways its unique shape will set you free!\n\nBounce Beauty Blender against your face when applying make up. Bouncing, called stippling in the make up world, blends make up without creating changes in the texture or tone of your skin. Use Beauty Blender 's pointed side for hard-to-reach spots like around the nose and mouth, and under the eyes. Use the round base for foundation and blush on the larger areas of your face such as your forehead, cheeks and chin.\n\nIf you apply make up with your fingers you will find that Beauty Blender will smooth and refine your make up to provide a clean finish.\n\nUse Beauty Blender damp when applying wet/dry make up. When Beauty Blender is wet it is normal for it to expand to nearly twice its original size. Wash after use and place in the Beauty Blender insert pedestal to dry. You can also put Beauty Blender in the Beauty Blender pouch and toss it in the dryer. Be sure to use an air-dry setting; Beauty Blender should not come in contact with extreme heat of any kind.\n\nIf you have problem skin Beauty Blender works to cover blemishes. Use the pointed end and the stipple and twist technique to work make up into depressed areas of the face. The stippling and twisting action feathers out the makeups edges, leaving a perfect finish.",
