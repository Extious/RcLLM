It strikes teens and adults alike, regardless of diet and lifestyle. Usually we don't even see it coming. Several weeks before it emerges, bacteria, dead skin cells and oil bond beneath the skin to form a blemish. Natural Results Acne Treatment System helps put a stop to the acne cycle by striking back - first at the core of a pimple and then across the surface. Finally, it helps prevent the development of new breakouts so skin stays clear, naturally. Our Easy-to-Use 3-Step System: Contains everything you need to stop the acne cycle and get consistently clear skin; Contains effective acne medicine without a prescription; Provides continuous acne control with daily use.",
