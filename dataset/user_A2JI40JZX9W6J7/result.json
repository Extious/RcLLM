    "description": "Additionals details \n \n Cicaplast Pro-Recovery Skin Care is for flaking, chapped skin or post-cosmetic peels. Cicaplast boosts the skin regeneration and helps to heal the skin. It is waterproof, invisible, non-sticky and easy to apply. This hydrating care immediately calms and soothes the skin.\n\nCicaplast is a heavy-duty epidermal repair accelerator ideal for skin which has been damaged and needs to repair fast to avoid aggravation.\nIt takes its inspiration from the concept of 'dressing' a wound to form a barrier rather than irritating it.\nCicaplast, which is infused with spring water, has exceptional cosmetic properties. Its creamy texture melts on the skin and becomes totally invisible.\nUltra-smooth, non-sticky and softening, it is easy to spread over the most irritated areas of skin.\n\nUSE:Apply three times a day on affected areas and use the thermal water compresses to soothe sensations of heat.\n\n\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS:\n\nActive ingredients which accelerate repair include copper, zinc and managanese mineral complex - the three trace elements which act on key stages of cell repair.\n\n\nSIZE: 40 ml./ 1.35 Fl.oz",
