    "description": "Why dermabrasion is so important in cosmetology? \nBecause our skin thickens with the age. When young we have 5-6 layers of horny cells on the skin.  As we age the number of layers increases to 7-8. Dermabrasion helps to rid us of these extra layers and helps toreveal smoother more glowing skin. \nDiamond dermabrasion is safer because it uses diamond chip covered heads rather than crystals. Diamond dermabrasion removes dead cell layers while massaging the face gently vacuuming debris away.  This helps to leave the skin fresher and more younger looking. Diamond dermabrasion is good for those who want to:\n-\tPrevent or reduce early wrinkle formation (diamond dermabrasion treatment helps to slow down the thickening of the skin).\n-\tLightens the skin (diamond dermabrasion helps to remove or lessen the pigmented top layer)\n-\tPrepare the skin for the cosmetics absorption (diamond dermabrasion will increase skin permeability)\n-                Lessens and may remove  superficial scars and imperfections (diamond dermabrasion will stimulate skin regeneration)",
