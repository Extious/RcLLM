    "title": "Professional 36 Watt UV Beauty Salon Nail Dryer - Pink",
    "description": "This premium UV nail dryer is designed to cure UV and gel-based coatings, and will work with any brand of nail products. It features four, long-life, CFL (compact-fluorescent) UV bulbs that provide 8,000 hours of service before any reduction in their power. Each bulb produces 9-watts of 370nm UVA light (generally considered a safer alternative to UVB light, although safety precautions should be taken to minimize exposure to any type of UV light). The unit features a total drying power of 36 watts. The 5\" long bulbs have a twin-tube design for effective light dispersion. The dryer has a reflective interior to eliminate hot spots and provide complete, even light coverage for best results. The bottom of the unit slides out for easy access to the bulbs, each of which features a secure, click-in retention lock to avoid the bulbs' loosening or falling out, a problem in some competing units. Each bulb is of a standard size for easy replacement. The unit arrives fully assembled and ready to use. Just insert the bulbs, plug it in, and turn it on. Two timer presets allow setting of two- and three-minute sessions. The unit measures 8-3/4\" wide, 9-3/4\" deep and 4\" tall, with a large drying area that measures 6\" wide, 6\" deep and 2-1/8\" tall for ample placement of hands or feet to avoid smudges. The unit also features foam feet to protect your work surface. Includes one premium salon nail dryer, four 9-watt CFL UV bulbs, 120-volt power cord, and instructions.",
