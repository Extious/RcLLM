    "description": "Here is what to do: Tip head forward, put on the turban, place hair into the turban, twist twist twist as much as needed, flip the end over, button and go.... Buy several of them to minimize shipping cost. This way you can use each once or twice then wash. This microfiber textile can withstand hundreds of washes, unlike cotton. You will enjoy your hair turban for years without having to replace them, and by ordering several at a time, you will never run out. Care instructions: Hand or machine wash in warm water with mild detergent. Tumble dry low heat setting. Do not use bleach or fabric softener as it would reduce the efficacy of the microfiber. Do not iron and do not dry clean.",
