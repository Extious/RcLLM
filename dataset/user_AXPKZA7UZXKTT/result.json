    "description": "Are you tired of the embarrassment of acne? Of the sun damage from days spent lounging by the pool and beach? Would you like to smooth out the fine lines and age spots that catch up with us all eventually? If you are like most of my clients, you would love to be able to look in the mirror and see clear, even toned, radiant skin, but are unable to afford the expensive treatments offered by spas and dermatology offices. Now you can use the same type of product your dermatologist and favorite spas offer in the privacy of your own home at a fraction of the cost. You owe it to yourself to see what a dramatic difference a Jessner's chemical peel can give you, not just on your face, but neck, chest and hands. This versatile peel has a proven track record of safety and great results.This kit contains:30ml (1 oz) of Jessner's peel solution pH 1.5, 2 fl oz Conditioning cleanser and 2fl oz deep moisturizing crme for post peel care. A complete instruction Manual is also included. The Jessner's Peel is a light to medium peel and is very safe. It is suitable for all skin types, especially those with oily or acne prone skin. It will greatly improve your skins tone and texture, taking years off of your face. As with all products, a patch test is required to see how your skin reacts. Those with aspirin sensitivity should not use this product.  Jessner's Peels are made up of three peeling agents at 14% each: Salicylic acid, Lactic acid and Resorcinol. Salicylic acid helps dissolve the dirt, sebum and debris in your pores that cause blackheads, enlarged pores and acne outbreaks and provides gentle exfoliation. Lactic Acid helps encourage cell turnover and stimulates collagen formation while smoothing and softening your skin. Resorcinol is an effective exfoliator that helps loosen the damaged skin layers to expose the new fresh skin beneath while also stimulating collagen. This is a wonderful peel and you will love the results!",
