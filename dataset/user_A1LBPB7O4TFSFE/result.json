    "description": "Natural & Organic Self Tanner, Scent Free Sunless Tanner finally, a truly natural self tanner that uses no dyes and artificial coloring agents. No more orange look to your skin! Beach Colours uses natural DHA, a vegetable substrate derived from sugar cane that colors dead skin cells and actually energizes one's own melanin to produce the skin's natural darkening process. Surrounding the natural DHA are moisturizers that will keep the skin from drying out while hastening the natural coloring of the skin. Organic Aloe Leaf; Cucumber and Melon extracts; Shea Butter; and Mandarin Oil invigorate and condition the skin during the speedy coloring process so it does not risk drying out. Now, a natural way to tan your skin when you cannot spend time in the sun due to time or weather. Beach Colours is fine to use while in the sun, as well, and expecially in preparation of going into the sun to establish a nice base tan. No Parabens are used as preservatives in our formulas, only food grade Natural Sorbate along with natural plant extracts and Natural Vitamin E from corn.",
