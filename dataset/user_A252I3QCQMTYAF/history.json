    "description": "Gratiae skin-care experts have set a new standard in age-defying cosmetic products. This superior, fast-acting, replenishing eye cream was designed specifically for the delicate, sensitive area of the human eye. It combats the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as reduces puffiness and black circles around the eyes. This replenishing eye cream contains a newly developed beneficial blend of thermo-mineral water, restorative natural flora, and organic oats and oil. It re-tones the skin, balances the moisture level, and boosts cell renewal. Simply apply the cream onto cleansed skin in soft circular movements until absorbed. For best results, precede the application of the Replenishing Eye Cream with an application of our Replenishing Eye Serum.  Here at GRATiAE Organics, we are committed not only to seeking and sustaining organic and natural materials, but also to using all our planet's resources wisely.  We use &#x201C;Responsibly Wild Crafted&#x201D; herbs which are harvested with minimal environmental impact and are replanted with long-term sustainability in mind. In addition, we're focused on Holistically balanced products which keep the plant constituents in a state of \"natural wholeness\" without adulterating any \"naturally-occurring bonds\".
