These materials help seal the hair cuticle to repel humidity and static, which results in incredible, lasting, frizz-free shine. The T Studio One-Inch Sleek and Curl Flat Iron heats up in just 30 seconds, cutting down on styling time. The flat iron also features Turbo Boost, which sets the styler to its highest temperature--430&deg;F--with just the press of a button. Additionally, Temperature Lock Mode allows you to lock the flat iron's buttons and cut back on accidental temperature changes and shutoffs, while Automatic Safety Shutoff turns the iron off after one hour.
