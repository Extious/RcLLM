    "title": "Blinc Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce Tube",
    "description": "Stop painting your lashes, tube them. Blinc is the original mascara invented to form tiny water resistant tubes around your lashes rather than painting them like conventional mascaras. Once applied, the tubes bind to your lashes and cannot run, smudge, clump, or flake, even if you cry or rub your eyes. Blinc mascara will add both volume and length to give you a radiant natural look that lasts all day. Only when you are ready for removal, the tubes will effortlessly slide off your lashes into your hand without the use of a harsh makeup remover. Made in Japan",
