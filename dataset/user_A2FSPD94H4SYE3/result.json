    "description": "Need to lighten those dark spots without using hydroquinone? Introducing Timeless Skin Lightening Cream, a non oily, luxurious cream. Unlike those other DIY peels and messy Vitamin C powders, our formula lightens gradually over the period of several months, preventing melanin formation. Other powder, peels, and hydroquinone creams simply work by exfoliation, are harsh and irritating, and don't address the underlying problem.This product contains:Arbutin - derived from bearberry leaves, arbutin is the natural alternative to hydroquinone. Inhibits melanin synthesis, thereby lightening dark spots.Vitamin C - antioxidant that evens skin tone and helps build collagen. We use Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, which is less irritating than L-Ascorbic Acid and does not decay as rapidly.Hyaluronic Acid - one of the most powerful hydrating and moisturizing ingredients on the market today. Used to transport the lightening ingredients into the skin and moisturize.And much, much more!",
