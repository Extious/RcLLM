    "description": "WHY VITAMIN C SERUM?Taking vitamin C through a supplement or food is beneficial to your health, but to specifically target signs of aging on your face, topical vitamin C is best. Applying Vitamin C to the skin is up to 20 times more effective than taking it orally - Dr. Oz. One of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. As you age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. Stabilizing your skin's levels of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production. Vitamin C helps boost collagen, which will bring elasticity to your skin and can prevent sagging in as little as 2 weeks - Dr. OzWhen it comes to treating age spots, you don't need chemical peels and lasers - Vitamin C can have almost the same results! Age spots are essentially sun damage, and Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. Using Vitamin C Serum is safer, cheaper, and easier than a facelift or chemical peel - Dr. OzThe length of time from when you start using Vitamin C until you see results varies with each person. Your skin will start to feel smoother and more supple within a few days. Most people will start to see improvements in coloration as soon as 2-4 weeks, it may take others 6-8 weeks to see a significant difference. After around 6 months, you'll reach the maximum benefits.100% NO HASSLE MONEY BACK GUARANTEEEveryone may not erase 10 years off their face with one bottle, but we are confident we have developed the absolute best Vitamin C Serum available. If you are not completely satisfied with Azure Natural's ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Serum we will refund your entire purchase price, no questions asked within one year of the original date of purchase!",

She told us that she mixes the facial salts with some olive oil and exfoliates that way with the combination of olive oil and facial salts. She said that she gets the exfoliating effect and the benefit of the minerals going in her skin, and her skin stays moisturized and smooth.\n\nNOTE: We also recommend for all skin types to mix these facial salts with our Mineral Cleanser which will create a gentle and thorough scrub. You can find that combination offered at a slight discount here.\n\nExfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts are designed for use on oily skin.
