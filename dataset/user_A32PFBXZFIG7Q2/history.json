Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.Advice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties. Early use of Retinol products can actually help to combat fine lines and wrinkles before they become apparent, so your skin stays looking younger and healthier.Start Slowly:Using Retinol is like exercising. You don't start out running a marathon. Begin by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, you may begin applying more frequently until find the best routine for your skin.RoC RETINOL CORREXIONEye CreamAt a Glance:Hypoallergenic2006 CEW Beauty Awards WinnerStick with It:It is important to be consistent, as the benefits of Retinol are seen over time.
