    "description": "Glycolic Acid has long been a first line product of the finest spas and Dermatology offices for improving the skin.  For those of you who have heard the term \"Lunch Time Peel\", this is the chemical used for it. Now you can do these peels at home safely and with fantastic results  After peeling your skin will be feel softer, look smoother, with improved texture and tone and reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage).  With a peel of this strength, a full course of peels (8-10 peels) are needed to see optimal results. This is a 1 fl oz (30 ml) of peel solution. Glycolic Acid is a naturally occurring chemical belonging to the Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) family.  Derived from sugar cane, this important AHA is the smallest of the fruit acids and is able to penetrate the skin, allowing it to effectively dissolve the \"glue\" that holds dead cells on the surface of the skin. The dead skin cells are what cause a dull, uneven skin tone, and the blocking of pores leading to blackheads and acne.  This dissolving action of the Glycolic Acid allows the dead cells to slough off, leaving behind a smoother skin surface with clear pores.  This also helps stimulate collagen formation under the skins surface which helps plump up the skin from beneath, smoothing out fine surface wrinkles and superficial scars. Our 40% Glycolic Peel is a mild glycolic acid peel and is suitable for all skin types and both beginning and experienced peelers. There may be some redness right after the peel, but generally there is not much if any actual peeling unless your skin is sensitive to the peeling agent. The 40% Glycolic peel is very safe when used as directed, but is a strong, professional strength peel (pH 1.5) and should be used only as directed.  As with all products, a patch test is recommended t0 see how your skin reacts to the peel. \nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",
