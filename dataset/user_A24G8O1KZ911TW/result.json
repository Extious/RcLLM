Frequently Asked Questions Will DevaCurl still work for individuals with permed curls instead of natural curls?Once hair is permed, it is considered curly and must be treated with the same care as naturally curly hair. Moisture is the key to success with curls so the more dehydrated, the more they encourage you to use their botanically infused and very moisturizing conditioners and styling products. Can those of us with straight hair use DevaCurl?Absolutely. This gentle sulfate free, paraben free, water soluble and&nbsp; botanically infused system is great for all curl types or hair that is worn straight as well as hair that has been chemically processed. What sets DevaCurl apart from other curly hair care product lines?&nbsp; DevaCurl is a 100% sulfate, paraben and silicone free system for curly, wavy and chemically dehydrated hair. Every DevaCurl product contains beneficial and moisturizing botanicals that rejuvenate, restore and respect curls' natural order. The unique Deva 3-Step technique has helped curly girls and guys to put down their weapons of mass curl destruction (straighteners, blow-fryers and harsh detergents) and embrace their natural curls. What is the Deva 3-Step and how often should I follow it? Cleanse, hydrate and define as often as your curls require. For some, the Deva 3-Step technique is a regular part of their daily routine and for others, once or twice a week is all it takes. To see the Deva 3-Step technique in action, watch here.",
