    "description": "Clear the way for the newest innovation in dry shampoo. Pronto dry shampoo invisible sprays on clear, which means it's completely undetectable in the hair and is ideal for all hair color. When applied, it instantly boosts volume and cleanses the hair without water. Ingredients such as gentle starches absorb excess oil and product build-up, while vitamin E and wheat proteins strengthen and protect the hair shaft. The end result is that hair looks and feels freshly shampooed, without a trace of residue.",

It is bright and golden in color and is regarded as the most favored in the carrier oil family because of its advanced molecular stability. Also makes a great scalp cleanser for the hair, and is equally wonderful for the skin because it has absorption properties that are similar to our skins own sebum.",
