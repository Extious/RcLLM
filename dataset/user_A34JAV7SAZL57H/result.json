    "title": "Winstonia Nail Art Double Ended Large Stamp and Plastic Scraper Set",
    "description": "Create beautiful stamping nail-art using Winstonia's large stamper! The white silicone pad is soft and squishy, with an up-and-down stamping motion instead of rolling, it transfers the image onto your nail evenly and covers the hard to reach area nicely!IMPORTANT I: This isn't regular rubber stamp, the white rubber is made from soft silicone gel which has a squishy and tacky feeling. This is normal and it aims to pick up the images and stamps without rolling, and to cover nail corners that regular stamper cannot reach.Instruction: Stamp in an up-and-down motion instead of rolling. Gently file the white pad a little bit if it won't pick up the image, use finest grit nail file.IMPORTANT CLEANING:DO NOTuse acetone, nail polish remover, cotton as these will cause DAMAGE on the pad. Instead, use scotch tape to tape down any residue. Or you may use lint-free roller.Winstonia is a US based seller. Check out our feedback...we ship fast!",
