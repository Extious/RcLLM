    "description": "Tourmaline Tools Lite by Hot Tools Professional Tourmaline 1875 watt hair dryer with Direct Ion technology and high airflow tourmaline dries hair up to 50% faster. Tourmaline converts heat into penetrating far-infrared energy, drying the cortex (interior) without over-drying the cuticle (exterior). Also helps cleanse hair of odors and impurities. Direct Ion Technology leaves cuticles silky, shiny, softer and less frizzy by breaking water into smaller easier-to-absorb droplets. Newly designed and engineered lightweight motor. Narrow 1-3/4\" European nozzle accepts most universal fit diffusers.",
