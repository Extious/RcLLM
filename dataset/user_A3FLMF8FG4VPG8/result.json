    "description": "2% Pure Retinol (Encapsulated for controlled release and stability). Strongest OTC strength Retinol Available.Why is Encapsulated Retinol better? Encapsulated Retinol releases a little at a time, benefiting the skin, but not shocking it into inflamed irritation. \nEncapsulation also preserves the potency of the Retinol molecule, ensuring it remains effective long term.Babyface's Night Renewal Cream is gentle, yet effective. With a strong potency (1700000 IU/g) it will get the job done, but without irritating like other products can. Best for those who have not used prescription retinoids before, or for those who prefer to achieve some of the same benefits, but without the irritation. Our effective formula was created to be a practical product that you can use daily. While not as fast acting as a prescription cream, the retinol in Night Renewal Creme is converted to retinoic acid slower and therefore there is little or no irritation. Compared to Retin-A, which usually produces results in about 4-8 weeks, the Night Renewal Creme is around 12 weeks.2% concentration of retinol (and 1700000 IU/g). Packaged in a light protected, airless jar for ease of use and to ensure freshness and effectiveness.Babyface Night Renewal Crme is a great option to harsher prescription products, and can also improve lines and discoloration, or be used as an acne treatment. Our retinol cream is gradually converted into retinoic acid (the active ingredient in the prescription creams) and results are seen at around 12 weeks for most people. Some will respond very quickly, but we do suggest giving it 3 months for real results.When using Retinol for treating hair loss, it is recommended to use it in combination with Minoxidil, as it's believed that Retinol boosts the penetration and effectiveness of the Minoxidil topical treatments.Cautions: Don't use vitamin A products if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

    "description": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight the look of deep wrinkles with RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Serum. It is clinically proven to visibly reduce both fine lines and deep wrinkles. After four weeks, skin is more radiant, fine lines on the face and neck are smoothed, and skin firmness is improved. After eight weeks, crow's feet are visibly reduced and the appearance of the signs of photo-damage are diminished. After 12 weeks, deep wrinkles on the face and neck are visibly reduced.How It WorksThis light, silky formula glides on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin feeling smooth and velvety. The formula's technology combines pure RoC RETINOL with magnesium, zinc, and copper to complement your skin's natural process and bring newer, younger-looking skin to the surface.Usage TipsUse RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Serum once or twice a day in the morning and/or evening. Cleanse skin and allow time to dry. Smooth product over face and neck allowing product to absorb completely.You may experience a slight tingling or tightness during use. This is normal and a sign that the product is working. Discontinue use if skin irritation develops and lasts. Follow with a gentle moisturizer or makeup if desired. If applying an additional moisturizer, use one free of Retinol or Alpha Hydroxy Acid. Apply a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day while using this product. Continue using a sunscreen for one week after stopping use.How Can RoC RETINOL Improve My Skin?Retinol is one of the most effective ingredients for reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.When you are young, your skin cells continuously renew themselves, which keeps your skin looking smooth. As time passes, however, your skin's ability to renew itself gradually slows down. Skin loses its elasticity and wrinkles become more evident. What you need is something to help keep it looking younger and healthier.This is the benefit of Retinol. Retinol is a pure form of Vitamin A that works to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.RoC RETINOL CORREXIONDeep Wrinkle SerumAt a Glance:After 4 Weeks:- Skin is more radiant- Fine lines on face and neck &nbsp;&nbsp;are smoothed- Skin firmness is improvedAfter 8 Weeks:- Crow's feet are visibly &nbsp;&nbsp;reduced- Signs of photodamage are &nbsp;&nbsp;diminishedAfter 12 Weeks:- Deep wrinkles on face and &nbsp;&nbsp;neck are visibly reducedAdvice for Getting the Most Out of Retinol ProductsStart Early:It is often recommended to begin using a Retinol product in your late twenties to early thirties. Early use of Retinol products can actually help to combat fine lines and wrinkles before they become apparent, so your skin stays looking younger and healthier.Start Slowly:Using Retinol is like exercising. You don't start out running a marathon. Begin by applying a small amount (a little goes a long way) every other day for about two weeks. After two weeks, you may begin applying more frequently until find the best routine for your skin.Stick with It:It is important to be consistent, as the benefits of Retinol are seen over time. If you happen to experience minor skin irritation, this may be temporary while your skin adjusts to the products. Just decrease usage for a few days and work your way back up after that.Protect your skin:Whether you use a Retinol product during the night or day, always remember to wear a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher during the day.RoC: A History of Skincare ExpertiseRoC brand was founded in France in 1957 by pharmacist Jean-Charles Lissarrague and a collaboration of dermatologists.

It is specifically formulated to thoroughly cleanse and prepare the skin for the treatment of a skin peel. It can also be used as an aggressive daily cleanser to maintain benefits.

During preening, a duck secretes oil from its preen gland and distributes it over its entire plumage in the familiar twisted-neck action that one often associates with ducks. This oil creates a thin, non-greasy layer on the surface of the feathers without which water would not pearl off and the bird would struggle to swim. This ingredient acts as a delivery system for Bio-Oil's other ingredients, improving spreadability and allowing for targeted absorption into the skin.Also, because oil contains no oxygen, it provides an exceptional storage environment for vitamins. Bio-Oil includes many beneficial skin ingredients such as Vitamin A, Vitamin E, calendula oil, lavender oil, rosemary oil, and chamomile oil. This mix of plant oils and vitamins has been clinically shown to be beneficial to the skin.Effective on Scars and Stretch MarksBio-Oil helps improve the appearance of all types of scars and is also highly effective in helping maintain elasticity of scar tissue on joints and other high-mobility areas, including stretch marks. Ideal for pregnant women, particularly in their second and third trimesters, Bio-Oil is the product most recommended by UK pharmacists to help reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks, and pregnancy stretch marks.Great for Skin Tone and Dry SkinBio-Oil helps improve the appearance of uneven skin tone caused by excessive sun, hormonal fluctuations, or skin-lighteners. Sagging and wrinkled skin that is associated with aging also benefits from Bio-Oil. Much wrinkled and sagging skin is caused by the weakening of the collagen and elastin support system in the dermis. Bio-Oil helps soften and smooth the skin, making it more supple and reducing the appearance of wrinkles.Bio-Oil also does a wonderful job at moisturizing and has sufficient moisturizing properties so as to render an additional moisturizer unnecessary.Non-Acnegenic and Hypo-AllergenicBio-Oil is a non-acnegenic and hypo-allergenic product, meaning it has a decreased tendency to cause allergies and acne, and it is safe for use on sensitive skin.",
