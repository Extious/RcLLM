    "title": "Complete Airbrush Nail Art Kit - 8 Color 240 Stencil Set",
    "description": "This complete nail-art starter kit from PointZero Airbrush includes everything needed to create gorgeous, professional looking designs. The package features a PointZero Elite-75E air compressor and PZ-270 airbrush. The unique, elephant-shape design compressor is compact and powerful (1/8 horsepower) and delivers approximately 48 psi of air pressure (0.55 CFM). The elephant's trunk contains the air outlet fitting, and the tail holds an airbrush in an integrated holder. An easy-carry handle is built into the back. The oil-less design makes this compressor suitable for food decorating and body/nail art and all other standard airbrushing applications. The PZ-270 is a premium, dual-action (trigger independently controls release of both air & fluid; pressing trigger releases air, pulling back releases material), internal-mix airbrush. Tight-tolerance head provides razor-sharp detail. Needle backstop at the rear of the airbrush allows you to pre-set the trigger travel; helping produce consistent line widths. Pre-installed 0.2mm for a spray pattern between hairline and 1\". Gravity-feed 2cc color cup. Also included are 20 individual, 4\" round nail stencil sheets, each with approximately 12-13 designs, totaling over 240 different patterns. The eight color, airbrush-ready, nail-art paint set is formulated with premium pigments and high-grade, acrylic resin polymers for gorgeous, vibrant luster and unrivalled coverage. Water-based and non-toxic. Included colors are Light Pink, Lake Blue, Lemon Yellow, Pearly Purple, White, Mid-Green, Scarlet & Black. A 6' braided air hose, barbed hose connector, paint pipette, nozzle wrench and instruction sheet complete the package.",
