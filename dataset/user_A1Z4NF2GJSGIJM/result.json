    "title": "BHA+ Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)",
    "description": "The BHA+ peel is a combination of chemicals in a single peel. This peel contains salicylic acid, lactic acid and resorcinol (another skin-peeling chemical) which together constitute a very adjustable peel which lends itself well to repeat applications. It is similar in many ways to Skin Laboratory's other peels, but there are certain important differences. The BHA+ peel penetrates more deeply into the epidermal layers of the skin and is gentler than chemical peels. Typically, there is no downtime and most clients are able to return to their normal activities soon after receiving treatment. Because they are gentler, however, several treatments may be required to achieve the best results.This peel is not recommended for people with sensitive skin, or those new to chemical peels. Skin Laboratory's Salicylic/20 is a great peel to get your skin accustomed to chemicals peels with less risk of irritation.Choosing the Best Peel:Skin Laboratory offers different types of chemical peels to help with things like exfoliating the skin and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles. If you are looking for the BEST peel for your condition, the following list will help you select it. The peels effectiveness is not limited to these conditions:Glycolic:Eczema &amp; Dermatitis, Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles, Razor Bumps, Stretch Marks and General Toning &amp; TextureLactic:Actinic Keratosis, Dark Circles Under Eyes, Dry Skin, Eczema &amp; Dermatitis, Melasma, Psoriasis, Razor Bumps, Scarring, Sensitive Skin, Stretch Marks, Sun Damage and General Toning &amp; TextureSalicylic:Acne, Acne Scars, Adolescent Skin, Large Pores &amp; Blackheads, Oily Skin, Psoriasis, Razor Bumps and WartsBHA+:Acne, Adolescent Skin, Large Pores &amp; Blackheads, Oily Skin, Psoriasis and WartsHQ+:Acne Scars, Actinic Keratosis, Melasma, Oily Skin and Scarring",

    "description": "Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in the extracellular matrix of human tissue. Topically applied hyaluronic acid forms an air permeable layer and penetrates into the dermis, thus boosting the elasticity and hydration of the skin. The protective breathable barrier on the skin locks in moisture which gives the skin a youthful appearance. The cuticular layer of the skin normally contains 10-20% water, however as we age it can drop to below 10%. Hyaluronic acid comes to the rescue with its unique ability to hold more than 1000 ml of water per gram of hyaluronic acid, which is a key factor in allowing the skin to retain more water. Amazingly, hyaluronic acid adjusts its moisture absorption based on the relative humidity in the air. It is the ideal ingredient in skin care products as it adjusts to the skin's need for a moisturizing effect depending on the relative humidity of seasons and climate of an area. Hyaluronic acid also protects the epidermis by scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by ultra violet light which would normally cause sunspots. Currently there are two forms of hyaluronic acid on the market; one derived from rooster comb and the other derived by the fermentation of yeast. Watts Beauty chooses the natural source over the cruel rooster comb source. In addition, in the lab there is more control over exactly how potent a product is and is not waived by an animals diet, etc...",

German and Roman spas have been using clay packs and treatments in the spas they built 4 000 years ago. Many of these spas still exist and use clay even today. Pliney the Elder devoted an entire chapter of his Natural History to the many uses of clay for pimples black heads and skin tightening.
