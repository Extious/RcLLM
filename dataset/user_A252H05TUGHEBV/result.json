    "description": "WHY VITAMIN C SERUM?Taking vitamin C through a supplement or food is beneficial to your health, but to specifically target signs of aging on your face, topical vitamin C is best. Applying Vitamin C to the skin is up to 20 times more effective than taking it orally - Dr. Oz. One of the most powerful functions of vitamin C is its role in the production of collagen, a protein that gives your skin its elasticity. As you age, collagen breaks down and wrinkles begin to form. Stabilizing your skin's levels of vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production. Vitamin C helps boost collagen, which will bring elasticity to your skin and can prevent sagging in as little as 2 weeks - Dr. OzWhen it comes to treating age spots, you don't need chemical peels and lasers - Vitamin C can have almost the same results! Age spots are essentially sun damage, and Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant, shown to reduce the number of sunburned cells as well as reverse age-related damage to skin. Using Vitamin C Serum is safer, cheaper, and easier than a facelift or chemical peel - Dr. OzThe length of time from when you start using Vitamin C until you see results varies with each person. Your skin will start to feel smoother and more supple within a few days. Most people will start to see improvements in coloration as soon as 2-4 weeks, it may take others 6-8 weeks to see a significant difference. After around 6 months, you'll reach the maximum benefits.100% NO HASSLE MONEY BACK GUARANTEEEveryone may not erase 10 years off their face with one bottle, but we are confident we have developed the absolute best Vitamin C Serum available. If you are not completely satisfied with Azure Natural's ULTIMATE VITAMIN C Serum we will refund your entire purchase price, no questions asked within one year of the original date of purchase!",
