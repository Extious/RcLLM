    "description": "This is unrefined shea butter and therefore still retains its medicinal properties. Shea butter has been used for centuries in Africa. It is used to moisturize and protect the skin from sun, wind, heat and salt water. It is known as the most effective skin moisturizer and conditioner because of its high content of non-saponifiable fats including vitamin f. It is an excellent skin moistener and is used for aging skin, eczema and all forms of massage. It is also used to relax the muscles and to treat sprains, wounds, and colds. The unique properties of shea butter also helps prevent and protect dry skin providing temporal relief from irritation, dryness, and wind burned skin.
