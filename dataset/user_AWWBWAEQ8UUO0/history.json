    "title": "Instant Heat Curling Iron, 1-Inch",
    "description": "Welcome to the world of advanced styling, where curling irons heat up in less than a minute, where you can choose between 25 different temperature settings for any hair type, and where, if left unattended, your curling iron automatically turns off. Conair's 1-inch curling iron is ideal for creating those medium-to-large bouncing curls. Featuring dual voltage settings, the iron allows you to select either standard North American 125-volt or 250-volt foreign electricity operation, so you can use your curler when you're traveling abroad. Its sure-grip handle has a patented design for greater control and precision, and the electronic on/off touch pad is easy to use. If you forget to turn off the curler (too busy fending off your admirers, we assume), it will automatically shut itself off. With that 60-second heat-up time and a flashing indicator light that lets you know when you can start styling, you'll have playful curls to impress within minutes. And with a two-year limited warranty, you'll be curling for years to come.--Ariel Meadow Stallings",
