The flexible hinge is adaptable to any tub shape including Roman tubs, air jet tubs and jacuzzis.Foam Fill for Solid ComfortThe interior resilience and support have also been upgraded, with foam fill that performs like a real pillow, without having to be inflated or guarded against punctures like an air pillow.7 Suction Cups (2 on the top section, 5 on the bottom section)You may have been disappointed with bath pillows that only have 2 or 3 suction cups, sliding out from under you just as you start to relax. That's why the Epica has a full 7 suction cups, to make sure that it will stay in your perfect position throughout your bath experience. Simply wet them first before pressing them onto the tub to ensure a tight seal.Easy Maintenance Vinyl CoverThe wipe-clean vinyl is chemical and odor resistant, and dries out faster than cloth covers to prevent mildew growth. As you rest on it, it will match your body temperature, creating a soft, warm nest for your head and shoulders.Light some scented candles, put on some soft music, pour in the bath salts, lie back...and enjoy!",
