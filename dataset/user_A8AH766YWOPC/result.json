This quick-drying sunless tanning lotion from Banana Boat allows you to get the deepest, richest tan that is achievable with your skin tone. The more often you apply it, the deeper your tan becomes. After achieving your desired color, you can maintain your tan with less frequent applications for a natural-looking tan.

    "title": "Grow Long Hair! BABYFACE PURE PROTEIN - Strongest Protein Available - Damaged Keratin Intense Deep Repair Protein Treatment - Hair Masque, Collagen Protein, Professional Strength Repair Mask Conditioner &amp; Filler - 6 Month Supply!",
    "description": "NEW Look (bottle is now brown with pink & orange label) - Same great product as always!1 oz bottle (10-14 treatments) which is a 6-Month Supply. Only $1.83 per Treatment!Babyface's Pure Protein is a unique product, better than traditional salon protein treatments, and safe for any hair type. Originally available only at select salons, now the original and potent formula is available for home use! The special formula took 7 years for our scientists to perfect, and allows protein to penetrate all the way to the hair's core, strengthening the hair shaft and adding structure. This also helps protect hair from chemical, heat and other damage. Treated hair takes color better, and colors last longer. Hair breaks less, allowing it to grow long faster! Pure Protein can be added to any chemical treatment to protect the hair from the damaging chemicals used in the process of coloring, straightening, perms and relazers. Stop damage before it starts! Restore strength and body to badly damaged hair. When used with a moisturizing conditioner, it instantly improves the feel and texture of dry, damaged hair and split ends. Makes hair strong and silky feeling again. (Note: Those with badly damaged hair may need to perform a few treatments before there is a noticeable difference. Follow directions carefully for best results.)Best when used with a moisturizing, waxy-type conditioner (protein loves moisture!) If hair feels dry after application, then most likely the conditioner was not moisturizing enough. You can apply conditioner again the next day to compensate for not enough used with treatment.  Never apply the protein directly to hair, must be mixed with conditioner. Do not use more than once every 14 days. Do not use on hair extensions secured with protein. Do not use Pure Protein when using other protein  products (including protein shampoos or protein conditioners). This product will not straighten your hair.",
