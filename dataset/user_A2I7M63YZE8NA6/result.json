    "title": "My Beauty Diary Arbutin Whitening Mask, 10 pcs",
    "description": "My Beauty Diary's Arbutin Whitening Mask's popular whitening ingredient, arbutin, is mild and comes from the ova ursi plant extract of vaccinium genus. This ingredient has superior effects in purifying, whitening and brightening, building a protective barrier that resists melanin. Moreover, Arbutin breaks down melanin beneath the stratum corneum, allowing skin to be whiter, and more radiant for a flawless and even toned look, whilst establishing an efficient melanin free system. Mon folium and prunus x yedoensis (types of Japanese cherry blossom) extracts are combined with the excellent anti melanin function of flavones to improve uneven skin tone, and rejuvenate the skin to a translucent glow. The fruit enzyme of pineapples and polyphenol protection of apples gently metabolizes dead skin cells, boosts skin fineness and translucency, thus defending the whiteness of skin to provide a flawless and vibrant translucent luminosity.",
