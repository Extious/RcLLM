    "description": "Not only does our Skin Obsession Pumpkin Peel smell good enough to eat, but it offers a multitude of skin benefits! Pumpkin contains more than 100 beneficial nutrients which can help to reverse the signs of aging.  This vegan certified peel contains high levels of Vitamins A and C which are alpha hydroxy acids and help increase cell turnover. Pumpkin also contains minerals like zinc, the antioxidant beta-carotene, and cancer fighting carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin. These all help fight the causes of aging. Pumpkin contains B vitamins, niacin, riboflavin, salicylic acid, lactic and ascorbic acid which are a whole group of chemicals with scientifically proven beneficial effects on the skin. They help promote skin healing, and restores skin's elasticity to give you a more youthful complexion.   In addition to the benefits of Pumpkin alone, we have added 5% Glycolic acid to help provide a youthful glow to dull skin and significantly increase cell turnover to yield a smoother, clearer, more beautiful complexion. This peel is good for all skin types and skin tones, except for extremely sensitive skin which can be irritated by the high percentage of active ingredients.  This is a 2 oz jar (60 fl oz) of Our Pumpkin Peel, enough for one to two months of bi-weekly treatments. We also include a free sample of our best selling Microdermabrasion Crystals. This peel can sting a little do the high concentration of active ingredients, but the results are well worth the discomfort.    Here at Skin Obsession we are committed to bringing our customers professional strength products at affordable prices so everyone can have the skin they want and deserve.",

    "title": "Skin Obsession 40% Glycolic Acid Peel for Acne, Scars, Age Spots &amp; Lines",
    "description": "Glycolic Acid has long been a first line product of the finest spas and Dermatology offices for improving the skin.  For those of you who have heard the term \"Lunch Time Peel\", this is the chemical used for it. Now you can do these peels at home safely and with fantastic results  After peeling your skin will be feel softer, look smoother, with improved texture and tone and reduced hyperpigmentation (sun damage).  With a peel of this strength, a full course of peels (8-10 peels) are needed to see optimal results. This is a 1 fl oz (30 ml) of peel solution. Glycolic Acid is a naturally occurring chemical belonging to the Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) family.  Derived from sugar cane, this important AHA is the smallest of the fruit acids and is able to penetrate the skin, allowing it to effectively dissolve the \"glue\" that holds dead cells on the surface of the skin. The dead skin cells are what cause a dull, uneven skin tone, and the blocking of pores leading to blackheads and acne.  This dissolving action of the Glycolic Acid allows the dead cells to slough off, leaving behind a smoother skin surface with clear pores.  This also helps stimulate collagen formation under the skins surface which helps plump up the skin from beneath, smoothing out fine surface wrinkles and superficial scars. Our 40% Glycolic Peel is a mild glycolic acid peel and is suitable for all skin types and both beginning and experienced peelers. There may be some redness right after the peel, but generally there is not much if any actual peeling unless your skin is sensitive to the peeling agent. The 40% Glycolic peel is very safe when used as directed, but is a strong, professional strength peel (pH 1.5) and should be used only as directed.  As with all products, a patch test is recommended t0 see how your skin reacts to the peel. \nBy purchasing this product, you assume all risk associated with its use and are responsible for all results either intended or unintended from using this product.",
