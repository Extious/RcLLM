    "title": "Ojoba Collective Raw, Unrefined Shea Butter: Fresh &amp; Creamy - Naturally Nourishing Skin Cream 100% Fair Trade from Ghana (4 oz/113g) Unscented",
    "description": "Our Raw Shea Butter is pure, unrefined, unscented & Fair Trade! Made in Ghana, Africa by the Ojoba Women's Shea Cooperative, this is one of the freshest butters out there! Safe for all skin types and great for natural hair.\nShea butter's made from kernels of wild African shea trees. All of our shea butter is made from wild-crafted kernels collected in a remote region where no pesticides or herbicides are used.\nNo chemicals are used to process our shea butter. It is traditionally hand-crafted by our women's cooperative, using the same method as their grandmothers.\nStudies have shown that raw shea butter is naturally high in antioxidants, essential fatty acids, lupeol, unsaponifiables, and cinnamic acid; all of which work to protect, heal and rejuvenate the skin and hair.\nMany shea butters products are chemically refined or diluted with inferior ingredients. All of this deprives the shea butter of its intrinsic healing properties. At Ojoba Collective we only offer fresh, raw, unscented shea butter. Nothing's added and nothing's taken away.\nPlease note: Raw shea butter has a natural, nutty scent. It is not an added fragrance, and will dissipate as it absorbs into your skin.\nSince we don't process our raw shea butter in anyway, you'll notice slight inconsistencies in texture.  Simply scoop out a small amount of our raw shea butter and rub it between your hands to melt it, and apply as needed.\nOjoba Collective is a member of Fair Trade Federation, Natural Products Association & a Gold-Certified member of Green America. The shea butter is regularly lab-tested to ensure quality, is vegan-friendly and never tested on animals!\nOur fair trade shea butter supports the Ojoba Women's Shea Butter Cooperative; empowering them and their community.  Benefits include access to education, health care, training in organic farming, and much more.\nOur Shea Butter is an eco-friendly, socially conscious, healthy alternative to chemical-laden beauty products.",
