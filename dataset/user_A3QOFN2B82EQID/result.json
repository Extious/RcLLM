    "description": "Having a hard time finding a powder puff for the body?\nYou've just found one!\n\nThis soft body puff is large enough to use on your body, this is not a compact size puff. Generously sized at 4.5\" in diameter and 1\" thick. Plush pink furry puff holds powder well, the satin hand strap helps keep puff in your hand. Best used with Dusting Powder, Body Powder or Fragrant Powders - beautiful and practical for daily pampering! Not suitable for Make-Up Applications.  Sold in a Pretty Satin Bag.\n\nIf you order this pink puff and one of our white puffs together, you will notice the fabric is a bit different. Same high quality you've come to expect, but the pink puff is made a little different.\n\nThis item is also available at www.buypowderpuffs.com\n\nWe hope that you will understand that due to the nature of this personal item we cannot accept returns. \nYou will be happy to know that the item you receive from us has never been returned or has been in the possession of someone else.\n\nIf you would like to try our puffs we recommend ordering just one in case it isn't what you are looking for.\n\nNOTICE: Because each puff is handmade and handsewn the actual size may vary slightly. Although the mfg. states this puff to be 4.5\" you may receive one that is a little smaller or a little bigger.\nTHIS IS NOT A VELOUR/VELVET STYLE PUFF!\n\nNOTICE:\nSome people feel that the puff is not fluffy enough or that it holds powder well.\nA brand new puff will not actually fluff up big and full until the fibers are filled with powder. Once the fibers fill with powder, the powder will not \"Fall Off\" the puff.\n\nPlease do not judge the puff until you have used it a few times, then you will see it become fuller and larger than it was when it was brand new!",
