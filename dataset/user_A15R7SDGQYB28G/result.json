    "description": "HOW TO USE FOILS?1) Prepare your nail bed by shaping, pushing cuticles back and removing all oils (do this using professional nail prep eg scrub fresh or nail polish remover.2) Apply a thin, even coat of nail foil adhesive to each finger. Wait for it to turn from white to clear and is just tacky to the touch. This can take up to 10 minutes! (Necessary)3) Press foil shiny side up, onto the nail bed and rub over using your finger, or for a better more precise application, use a rubber hoof stick. (for best results cut a piece of foil of the length just big enough for the nail, its easier to control and apply flat)4) Remove the foil and the foil pattern should be stuch to your nail. If a bit is missing due to lack of foil adhesive, just reapply the adhesive to the part not taken and repeat.5) Once completely dry, apply a coat of sealer/top coat to protect the foil. If the adhesive is not completely dry before applying the top coat, the foil will rub off.Warm Tips:1, Just remember if it doesn't work first time, Try again! It's all about the timing of applying the foil to the adhesive at the right time.2, Foils can take a while to get right, but once you do get the hang of it, you can create lots amazing Nail DESIGNS!PLEASE NOTE THAT DUE TO LIGHTING EFFECT AND COMPUTER COLOR, THE ACTUAL COLORS MAY BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTUREItem included:\n12 different styles Nail Art foil in jar .",
