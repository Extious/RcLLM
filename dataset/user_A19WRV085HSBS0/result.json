    "description": "A refreshing antioxidant shield with flash-firming properties to improve skin texture while intensely hydrating dry, dehydrated skin.  Convenient mist-on formula supplements skin's protective barrier by creating an active antioxidant shield of White Tea, Licorice and Vitamin E to fight damaging free radicals, while a patented polypeptide helps prevent the signs of aging caused by Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs - a damaging byproduct of sugar/protein reactions in the skin).  A highly-active Vitamin C complex, combined with collagen-stimulating peptides, encourages firmness and elasticity to help reduce the appearance of fine lines.  Hyaluronic Acid acts as a hydration magnet to quench dehydrated skin while Pea Extract creates instant firming action to lift and tighten.  Rose and Clove extracts comfort and refresh skin.",
