Fast forward 35 years to France. In September 2005, Conair's French subsidiary BaByliss introduced a patent-pending design to control frizz, straighten hair, and to add shine and volume in one revolutionary step. Their BeLiss styler effectively eliminated the need for a hairbrush for straightening, and by the end of the year it was the number one seller in France. Conair introduced this new technology to the U.S. in the form of the Infiniti Hair Designer, a high-end, professional-caliber styler that produces salon-quality results at home.What's in the BoxConair 208 Infiniti hair designer, straightening attachment, and concentrator attachment.",
