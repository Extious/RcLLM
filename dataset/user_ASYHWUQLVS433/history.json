And all of the brushes feature a long, easy-to-grip handle for precision during application.Handmade from Animal Hair for a Soft, Silky FeelThe cosmetics brushes are made from natural goat and badger hair, so they are soft and silky on top, yet firm and durable on the bottom. The brushes allow you to apply colors smoothly, while pigment does not cling to the hairs after application, so you can blend and reuse colors without cleaning every time.Handmade with care, each brush in the set is engraved with the SHANY logo.Easy to Clean and DryYou do not need to clean these brushes frequently, but when you do wash, it's easy--simply run the brushes under warm water, clean them with your favorite shampoo, and rinse thoroughly.

Brushes should be cleaned once before first use.Convenient Storage Pouch for Organization and TravelFor easy organization, the brushes are packaged in a black folding pouch that you can easily toss into your gym bag or suitcase. Extendable trays in the pouch offer additional storage space for extra items, like your favorite jar ofSHANY Mineral Eye Sparkle Eye shadow (Set of 40 Jars)(sold separately).
