    "description": "By drying your brushes vertically, you protect their bristles and keep water from the ferrule. The Benjabelle Daisy Brush Tree can hold 2 large brushes, 4 medium and 8 of your thinner eye and lip brushes.\n\nThe same size as the Mini Brush Tree, the Daisy is compact and perfect for drying your brushes in any space. When collapsed, the Daisy is the size of popular e-book readers.  It stores flat so you can tuck it away for easy storage.\n We use only American made material in our Brush Trees. The super soft silicone grippers are peroxide free and meet FDA safety rules. They will safely hold but never damage your brushes.",
