    "title": "Certified Organic Cocoa Butter, Pure, Raw, Unrefined. Incredible Quality and Scent. Use for Lotion, Cream, Lip Balm, Oil, Stick, or Body Butter. Organically Grown on Small Family Farm in the Dominican Republic. Best Cocoa Butter on Amazon! (1 Pound)",
    "description": "This is the highest quality cocoa butter available on Amazon! Trust us, we've tried them all. We sampled numerous batches of cocoa butter from all over the world, including Ghana, Equador, and the Caribbean. We chose this for it's phenomenal chocolatey scent and pure, organic qualities.\n\nWe pride ourselves in bringing you the freshest cocoa butter we can find. Therefore, the cocoa butter may come in either block or wafer form. \n\nCocoa butter in its natural state is temperature dependent, and is quite hard at room temperature. We recommend heating it with your fingers, a hairdryer, or the microwave for easier application on the skin.\n\nCocoa butter, also called cacao butter, is the cream-color fat extracted from cacao seeds (cocoa beans) and used to add flavor, scent, and smoothness to chocolate, cosmetics, tanning oil, soap, and a multitude of topical lotions and cream. Cocoa butter has been called the ultimate moisturizer, and has been used to keep skin soft and supple for centuries. It is one of the most stable, highly concentrated natural fats known and melts at body temperature so that it is readily absorbed into the skin. Cocoa butter is often recommended for treatment of skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. When applied topically, it creates a barrier between sensitive skin and the environment and also helps retain moisture. \nPregnant women have long used cocoa butter formulations to prevent and treat stretch marks, but this pleasant-smelling substance is added to countless other topical preparations as well. Lotions and oils containing cocoa butter are often used in aromatherapy massages to promote feelings of relaxation and well-being. Recent research indicates that massaging the skin with cocoa butter may help relieve stress.",
