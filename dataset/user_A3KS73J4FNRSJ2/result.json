    "description": "Our Bee Sunny mineral sunblock is a great way to create protection while outdoors.  It is easy to apply and very effective.  Just apply in a grid pattern to ensure even coverage.\nWe changed to new packaging February 2014 and the formula has twice the blocking power.\n\nRecommended by the skin cancer foundation as a superior UV sunscreen.\n\nThe combination of uva and uvb broad spectrum sunscreen coverage comes for 34% active ingredients including Zinc and Titanium.  \n\nZinc is an essential mineral required by the body for maintaining a sense of smell, keeping a healthy immune system, building proteins, triggering enzymes, and creating DNA. Zinc also helps the cells in your body communicate by functioning as a neurotransmitter. A deficiency in zinc can lead to stunted growth, diarrhea, impotence, hair loss, eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, and depressed immunity.\n\nTitanium Dioxide or titanium (IV) oxide or titania, is a substance that occurs naturally as three mineral compounds known as anatase, brookite, and rutile.  It is most commonly extracted from titanium tetrachloride by carbon reduction and re-oxidization. It has very high refraction properties. In fact, titanium dioxide is one of the whitest materials known to exist on Earth. It reflects light away from the skin. It is a major component of our sun block to deter the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun, the concentration of which determines the product's Sun Protection Factor, or SPF.\n\nWatch the youtube video with our Queen Bee formulator for more information.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/QueenBeeSkin",
