Skin Irritations - Minor skin irritations including: allergies, insect bites, frostbites, sunburns, burns, and small skin wounds all respond positively to Shea Oil treatment.\n4. Dry Hair and Scalp - Apply to hair and scalp to add moisture to dry, brittle hair; to prevent weak hair from breaking, fading or thinning out; to prevent dandruff; and revitalize split ends. Shea Oil will protect hair from the damaging rays of the sun, hair dryers, perms and dyes\n5.

Once Shea Oil is aged or loses its natural integrity through high heat refinement, many of these wonderful benefits are lost. Although moisturizing, Shea Oil that has been over processed, bleached and deodorized, is ineffective in healing most skin conditions. That is why we use only cold pressed, unrefined Shea Oil.",
