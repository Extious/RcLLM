    "title": "Babyface Night Renewal Cream 2% Encapsulated Retinol (1,700,000 IU/g) Non-Irritating Retinol OTC for Skin Tone Correction, Resurfacing, Anti-Aging, Acne",
    "description": "2% Pure Retinol (Encapsulated for controlled release and stability). Strongest OTC strength Retinol Available.Why is Encapsulated Retinol better? Encapsulated Retinol releases a little at a time, benefiting the skin, but not shocking it into inflamed irritation. \nEncapsulation also preserves the potency of the Retinol molecule, ensuring it remains effective long term.Babyface's Night Renewal Cream is gentle, yet effective. With a strong potency (1700000 IU/g) it will get the job done, but without irritating like other products can. Best for those who have not used prescription retinoids before, or for those who prefer to achieve some of the same benefits, but without the irritation. Our effective formula was created to be a practical product that you can use daily. While not as fast acting as a prescription cream, the retinol in Night Renewal Creme is converted to retinoic acid slower and therefore there is little or no irritation. Compared to Retin-A, which usually produces results in about 4-8 weeks, the Night Renewal Creme is around 12 weeks.2% concentration of retinol (and 1700000 IU/g). Packaged in a light protected, airless jar for ease of use and to ensure freshness and effectiveness.Babyface Night Renewal Crme is a great option to harsher prescription products, and can also improve lines and discoloration, or be used as an acne treatment. Our retinol cream is gradually converted into retinoic acid (the active ingredient in the prescription creams) and results are seen at around 12 weeks for most people. Some will respond very quickly, but we do suggest giving it 3 months for real results.When using Retinol for treating hair loss, it is recommended to use it in combination with Minoxidil, as it's believed that Retinol boosts the penetration and effectiveness of the Minoxidil topical treatments.Cautions: Don't use vitamin A products if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

Derived from red clover, one of nature's&nbsp;richest sources, Promensil is the only supplement that delivers the four major dietary plant estrogens - genistein, biochanin, daidzen and formononetin. Some sources like soy&nbsp;contain only two.Promensil is clinically proven to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats without the worry of weight gain. Promensil also maintains bone health and lets a woman feel like herself again by promoting emotional well-being.*Promensil is particularly recommended as a dietary supplement for women interested in replenishing and maintaining healthy estrogen levels to preserve physical and emotional well-being before and during midlife.*Midlife as Nature Intended.Promensil&nbsp;is free of&nbsp;yeast, milk derivatives, wheat, cornstarch, gluten, preservatives, artificial colors and artificial flavors.

    "description": "Our fabulous creation NuElle contains a cocktail of 25 well known flub busters that assist in weight loss and cellulite reduction, like caffeine, L'Carnitine, Butcher's Broom, Bladderwrack, Ivy and many others. Formulated to work both on the surface and in depth, this revolutionary treatment has multiple performance that can be seen with the naked eye within 2-3 weeks. Firming on the surface, detoxifying on the inside, reducing water retention and fat cell clusters, while improving circulation and overall appearance of the skin. Directions: Apply in circular motions twice a day, on all affected areas, specially on thighs, buttocks, stomach - to help to reduce the appearance of cellulite. (Preferably two hours after eating or one hour before meal. Your body will only burn fat when it has none in the bloodstream.) This product creates slight \"sauna\" effect that may cause you to sweat more on the areas where the product was applied. Warning: Use only as directed. Do not ingest. Keep out of reach of children. Due to diuretic effect this product may cause, we do not recommend this product for use while pregnant. For best resits we suggest to use it with our L'or de la Mer Organic Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub with Seaweed and Phat QR Body Massager.",
