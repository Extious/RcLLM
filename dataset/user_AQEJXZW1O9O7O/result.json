    "description": "When it comes to curling irons, structural extras are always  second to quick, effective heat. The Revlon Perfect Heat curling iron  doesn't have much in the way of frills, but it does deliver safe,  consistent heat with a minimal cooling period between uses. Ideal for  creating extra-large curls and volume, the 1-1/2-inch barrel on this  iron has a clamp with a wide, conveniently snug thumb lever and a  stay-cool tip for extra control during styling. In addition to the 60-second  heating time, the iron includes an automatic shutoff, a power indicator  light, and a built-in prop to keep the barrel off the bathroom counter.  The stand is somewhat shorter than on most irons and the cord doesn't  swivel, but the barrel is so maneuverable that these minor drawbacks  aren't much of a problem. Even better, Revlon builds this iron with  worldwide voltage, so travel is easy.--Emily Bedard",
