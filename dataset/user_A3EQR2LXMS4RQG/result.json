    "description": "Introducing... Arouse-Rx. The First Ever 25x Pheromone Concentrate!Have you ever noticed a gal who, although not extremely good-looking or highly stimulating, seems to attract men by the dozens? Chances are that her naturally occurring pheromone release is higher and more detectable than yours! Now it is possible for any woman to harness the primal sexual power that comes from pheromones.The Science of ArousalArouse-Rx is an odorless, scientifically formulated blend of four pheromones specifically designed to arouse and attract men. We use only pure reagent-grade human sex pheromones of the highest concentration allowed by law.  This formula is sexual attraction dynamite!!What Are Pheromones?Pheromones are odorless chemicals excreted from the body that affect reproductive interactions among both animals and humans. They are picked up by a special organ in the nose, and then conveyed to regions higher up in the brain.How Is Arouse-Rx Used?Simply apply two to three drops on the neck and wrists and rub well into skin. Arouse-Rx will mix with your own body chemistry to create an undetectable scent that will drive men crazy!What Makes Arouse-Rx Different From Other Brands?Most brands contain only one or two pheromone compounds. Arouse-Rx contains all four main pheromones found in humans which are responsible for primal sexual attraction. But we did not stop there. Other products claim to be powerful, but Arouse-Rx is the only brand allowed to be sold in the US with a 25x concentration of active ingredients. This is 2 1/2 times stronger than the leading brand! Compare us to the competition and you will find there is no better product available on the market today.Try Arouse-Rx Today, Risk-Free!If you are not completely satisfied with your results after using Arouse-Rx for 90 days, simply return the unused portion for a full refund.  It's that easy!",
