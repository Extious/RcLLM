In fact, it's so scientifically advanced that it is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Using the custom container, you simply shake Toppik over your thin areas. These organic keratin protein fibers have the same organic makeup as your own hair. So they naturally intertwine with your own hair to make it look thick and full in less than 30 seconds. You'll be amazed how these hair building fibers transform your thin, colorless \"vellus\" hairs.",
